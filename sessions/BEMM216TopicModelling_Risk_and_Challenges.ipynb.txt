The biggest immediate challenge we face is hitting the minimum income eligibility required to register our charity officially. But once we raise just £2,500 more we can apply to Charities Commission to register officially, which opens a whole world of opportunity up to us! The registration process can take up to 40 days so the sooner we get our application in the better. We’re giving ourselves a big lead time to starting the build, ensuring we can realistically register and secure funding before work commences in January. As part of progressing the design of the theatre, we have to have the ceiling load tested and the room surveyed. This will help us design a theatre that is not only unbelievably sexy, but safe too. The sooner we can get the surveyor in, the more quickly we can deal with any issues, adapt the design where necessary, and finalise the details ready to go to the funders to apply for the £20,000 we need to commence the build. To minimise risk for this project, we’ve allowed the best part of a year to overcome these challenges. Once this foundation stage is completed we will know exactly what we are up against. This will help us overcome future obstacles on the road to building the first pub theatre in Cardiff. The benefits of the seed funding don’t stop at getting the build on the go.

The fact that this is a challenge that Kate is embracing is a testament both to her own vision and to the current potential of the Cardiff fringe scene.”  John McGrath, Artistic Director, National Theatre Wales “Cardiff needs a new producing house of this scale and Kate Wasserberg is exactly the right person to run it. I am very excited by her plans and look forward to them becoming reality.” Tim Price, Playwright. “The Finborough has shown how ‘small theatre’ can create a national impact. That is Kate’s ambition for Cardiff.

We specialise in performance and visual arts. It was set up by Sisters Lil and Kitty Rice early last year. We wanted to find a way of mixing our love of music, art, theatre and Circus and so in June 2013 put on our first show. Our first two shows were a huge success but we did it all on a wing and a prayer AND a shoestring! We are so excited to have started this company and we're really keen to evolve and expand.Kitty and Lil work closely with the artists to create several short ‘acts’. A circus artist or dancer works with a band or musician writing original songs or learning covers to form a forty minute show. This show will feature the amazing Marika Hackman. Lil Rice and Ollie Clark will also be playing While Lil focuses on directing and choreographing the show, Kitty is learning to build sets and organises the aesthetic of the show.We also would like to let you know that this is an ongoing and hopefully long term project.

Many delays were part of the construction process. At one point, we had a front-loader digging out the lobby floor inside the building, and staff working on the floor above. We had lots of dust, power outages, pounding, sawing, and many days of just plain mind-numbing noise. We had to move the light pole on the street in order to make the building more accessible (and watched it moving outside our office window, from left to right!). \\nAt the same time all this was happening, we produced three productions and a major fundraiser in between phases of the project! We would just clean up the building, build sets, rehearse, and move forward. After that, we are confident that we can navigate any challenge or difficulty we may encounter, although we would all prefer never to see a front-loader in the building again!\\nLuckily, the new sound system will not require a front-loader!

We now have a flexible theatre space, designed for professional theatre productions, as well as concerts, special events and other community functions. We're focused on creating the creative center, where our community experiences theatre, art and music.In addition to its Equity theatre season, in the past year we have established Oldcastle Theatre Downtown Arts, which encompasses programming including concerts, special performances by exceptional theatre artists, and children's performances by Oldcastle Actors' Express. Our community programming has been expanded to include school programs and community education programs with professional theatre arts. We have hit the ground running, and this past year has been amazing --- a year of self-discovery for us and a year of new experiences for our audiences.  Looking to the future, one of the main goals of our renovation project is to make the building accessible to as many people as possible.

We produce some of the most unique comedy festivals in the world. In 2011, New Orleans natives Chris Trew and Tami Nelson moved back home from Austin with the intention of putting New Orleans on the comedy map. They opened a small comedy theater and training center in 2011, and they did big things in a short period of time. Here's a video about what TNM was like back then.After 2 years in the small, musty space on Burgundy, The New Movement is proudly expanding our comedy-creating operations to a beautiful, spacious spot at 2706 St. Claude. This move not only allows us to teach more classes, it creates new show slots and seats a larger audience.  Additionally, the TNM community will have access to a podcast recording booth, a video production studio complete with a green screen wall, green room with all the amenities for performers, and classrooms dedicated to both Improv and Sketch Writing. This is a huge step up for our homegrown business and we’re fully committed to make this leap because we believe in our comedy and community.

The first gives us a glimpse into the lives of four people who live together in a polyamorous household, and experience all the pleasure and (mostly) pain that comes along with it. That's Poly.The second vignette explores what happens when we lock two people in a bunker with little to do but \"get to know\" each other.

By way of Dublin, Amsterdam and finally Glasgow, he recounts his battles with mental health issues, crises of confidence, gang related crime and eventually time behind bars.'Bloom''s stories will be accompanied by a live soundscape and an array of live images. Through this blend of image, sound and narrative, the production will reinstate the tales of two fascinating individuals and their plight.\\n\\nAvoiding a didactic approach to socially conscious theatre, it will reflect the cyclic, hereditary and, at times, contagious...</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1368</th>\n      <td>Every production &amp; company has their challenges during the creative process.

She has to pay for flights for those involved in production (herself and her director), she has to secure a place to stay, and she's gotta eat while she's there! She also has additional payments for the venue/crew of her show, and technical aspects she needs to successfully perform her production.This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, and since God has clearly provided thus far, she doesn't see why finances have to get in the way! Artists like Mindy Kaling, John Leguizamo, and Whoopi Goldberg have started great careers doing solo shows. Emma's show deals with many different topics. She talks of two syndromes, Nail Patella and Downs. She also deals with issues such as discrimination, gender equality, racism, religion, fitting in with society, and finding your identity. This show, if performed in New York, could lead to other awesome things!

The Grimm Fairy Tales meets 'Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind'. A girl wakes up with no idea of who she is. No memories. No identity.

The biggest immediate challenge we face is hitting the minimum income eligibility required to register our charity officially. But once we raise just £2,500 more we can apply to Charities Commission to register officially, which opens a whole world of opportunity up to us! The registration process can take up to 40 days so the sooner we get our application in the better. We’re giving ourselves a big lead time to starting the build, ensuring we can realistically register and secure funding before work commences in January. As part of progressing the design of the theatre, we have to have the ceiling load tested and the room surveyed. This will help us design a theatre that is not only unbelievably sexy, but safe too. The sooner we can get the surveyor in, the more quickly we can deal with any issues, adapt the design where necessary, and finalise the details ready to go to the funders to apply for the £20,000 we need to commence the build. To minimise risk for this project, we’ve allowed the best part of a year to overcome these challenges. Once this foundation stage is completed we will know exactly what we are up against. This will help us overcome future obstacles on the road to building the first pub theatre in Cardiff. The benefits of the seed funding don’t stop at getting the build on the go.

Training the staff on the new equipment and maintaining the equipment in good working condition could also be a potential obstacle.   \n10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              City permits in historic downtown can be a tricky process but not impossible.  Our rock star team of architects/contractors are working closely with city officials to make sure the renovations, and our signage, are done right!   \n11                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Thankfully we have the performers we wanted, we've chosen the venue we want. But its show business so anything can happen. So we've got back ups in place and have experience in adapting to obstacles. We are excited to send your our thank you gifts but need you to understand that some may take longer than expected to be created and delivered due to process, materials and stockists. But of course we'll do our best to get them to you when promised.   \n12                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            In the past eighteen months, the staff at Oldcastle Theatre has been in the middle of a major construction project. Many delays were part of the construction process. At one point, we had a front-loader digging out the lobby floor inside the building, and staff working on the floor above. We had lots of dust, power outages, pounding, sawing, and many days of just plain mind-numbing noise. We had to move the light pole on the street in order to make the building more accessible (and watched it moving outside our office window, from left to right!). \\nAt the same time all this was happening, we produced three productions and a major fundraiser in between phases of the project! We would just clean up the building, build sets, rehearse, and move forward. After that, we are confident that we can navigate any challenge or difficulty we may encounter, although we would all prefer never to see a front-loader in the building again!\\nLuckily, the new sound system will not require a front-loader! However, it will require some technical expertise, patience, and a good sturdy ladder to get up into the ceiling. Thankfully, we have all of those things and we are ready to get started!!   \n13                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    We’ve got lots of increased day-to-day costs like utilities, insurance, etc. The upstairs area is mostly built out, so we can start teaching classes, producing content, and having fun up there, which is HUGE. We’re currently waiting for one final permit to get approved and then we jump on this thing full force.Of course, all of the demo-ing and construction and legal paperwork could wind up costing us more than the $50k we're estimating right now, so we've got Stretch Goals, and if we raise much more than the goal of this campaign, you can be guaranteed that every bit of that money will go right into creating the most special home for comedy that ever existed.   \n1362                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           This is a micro-budget production and a labor of love. Your support will go directly to covering the major costs of the production: venue rental, securing the rights to the material, rehearsal space, the Fringe registration fee, and many more.   \n1363                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    There are always obvious risks when going to the fringe but the main one is losing money. The Fringe is a very expensive venture and the venue alone costs over £2000. We have been applying for funding and in the process of negotiating for some from LIPA. We are also organising a fundraiser gig on the 22nd May to raise money but this may still not cover all the costs of the fringe. Our main challenge is getting bums on seats during our run. We have been drawing up a very clear marketing plan for the run up to the Fringe and advertising when there. Marketing strategies that are in the pipeline for the Royal Mile include using a large puppet of David Cameron, Gorilla marketing and staging parades of protest.   \n1364                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Where there is art, there are risks and challenges. We will not let any of those get in our way. It's on, baby. This show will happen come hell or high water... Your donation will be instrumental in helping us get there......and you will be regarded as one of the most awesomest persons in the universe.   \n1366                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We projected 2,700 dollars to cover our expenses for this opportunity. The expenses are: \\n$40 initial application fee \\n$500 festival participation fee \\n$900 advertising campaign\\n$700 transportation of equipment and ourselves to, from, and within NYC\\n$560 lodging and petty cash for a week in NYCAs you know, if we don't reach our projected goal we won't receive any of it. This is a risk we are willing to take because we believe that you believe in what we want to achieve as well.\\nThe key component is promoting before and then on location the week prior to showtime. Our main goal is to fill the theatre for our show; if we do that, the festival grants us a second performance. That is really good.Also, If there are any complications once we get to the festival we want to make sure we can efficiently overcome them with ease.   \n1367                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The greatest challenge of successfully taking a show to the Fringe is producing both a quality production and strong off-stage efforts to garner an audience.We aim to cultivate a compelling performance in 'Bloom' and support it with an effective campaign on the streets of Edinburgh and online so we may share it with as many audience members as possible.We plan to work tirelessly to vindicate our Kickstarter supporters and ensure 'Bloom' enjoys a successful and memorable stint at the 2014 Fringe.   \n1368                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Every production & company has their challenges during the creative process. As a company, Ruddy Productions embraces the challenges we have faced thus far and will continue to do so in the future. We can guarantee you that the money you donate will only be the beginning of what is to come for us. We hope you continue to follow us on our journey through all the risks we will take & successes we will achieve as a new company.

The show goes up JUNE 13. 14, and 15 - THE FIRST WEEKEND OF THE FRINGE FESTIVAL!!!  The final three shows (on JUNE 21, 22 and 28) may benefit from word of mouth, but we want to fill our houses with KICKSTARTER SUPPORTERS for our opening weekend!When purchasing tickets, PLEASE BE SURE TO WRITE A COMMENT TO US WITH YOUR NAME AND THE DATE OF THE SHOW YOU'D LIKE TO ATTEND SO THAT WE CAN RESERVE YOUR SEAT(S)!!  ;)Check out the rewards to the right - you can help us put on the best show possible by purchasing tickets in advance - and this way, you get some other swell options like t-shirts, Shakespearean video thank yous, and a possible MENTION IN THE SHOW!I know we can succeed and reward you with an evening of hysterical, smart, and irreverent comedy this Summer!  Thank you for your support and we look forward to seeing you soon!   \n1370                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               This is our seventh year so I don't think there is a chance we will not fulfill our obligations. I guess if we dropped the ball and didn't fulfill our commitments we would have egg on our face, but I'm not planning on that!   \n1371                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      With every project there are potential obstacles, room for delay or mishaps...With our cast, we have fortunately only had one obstacle laid in front of us, which so happens to be our actor who plays Dracula has broken his leg..Unfortunately accidents happen, but as ours is a physical theatre play Dracula is resigned to watching rehearsals on his crutches!But have no fear! He is due out of his cast one week before our first performance!?!We are confident and progressing through our rehearsals with the rest of the team!We hope to face no other such challenges with regards to our actors or show!

This is our fifth production. If there was any risk at all, it would be if something happened to the theater venue (flood, earthquake, overrun by bobcats), thus preventing the production to move forward at that venue.We would reschedule the event and honor all the tickets guaranteed for the show.   \n1373                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I'm really excited to be working with two such experienced producing partners.  Lee Costello has a long resume full of directing and producing credits from both New York and Los Angeles.  Michael Blaha, who is both an entertainment attorney and an enthusiastic theatre producer, has taken many innovative shows from Los Angeles across the pond to the famed Edinburgh Festival in Scotland.  In addition to Lee and Mike, the festival already has a highly experienced crew of playwrights, directors and designers who are all tremendously excited to see where this festival will take us.  With such a remarkably talented team in place, we're confident that we can handle all the challenges that lie ahead.  With your kind help, look for Sci-Fest to arrive in Los Angeles in May of 2014!   \n1374                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Having taken shows to The Edinburgh Fringe before we understand all too well the risks and challenges that are involved- its incredibly competitive to find an audience for your show, the reviewers might hate the show, they might love the show but not print the review, or worst of all they might not even come! The van might break down, the set might fall apart, it might rain for 3 weeks solid.... it probably will rain for 3 weeks solid BUT this is just part of the magic of the festival and we have overcome these problems before and we are happy to take them on all over again because we love the two shows we have made and we are hoping you are going to love them too. Thank you for taking the time to look at our page and helping us reach our goal!   \n1375                                     The worry with any one man play is that if the actor goes down, there's no one to jump in and save the day. Edinburgh is a intense experience for any performer, but even more so for a cast of one. However we have made informed decisions both in our planning for the Fringe and our casting of James to ensure that our audience and our backers are not left disappointed. We have scheduled two days off over the course of the run to give James time to recharge. We will also ensure that the rehearsal process is structured to support James' way of working as much as possible, so as not to exhaust him before we even cross the border. However we are confident that James has the stamina to give Bruce his all, day in, day out, because of his previous Edinburgh track record. James was just seventeen when he performed in Fiona Evans' Fringe First winning 'Scarborough', a play that he had to perform three times a day for the whole run. We have every confidence in him and hope that you do too.The other risk is that, despite the generosity of our Kickstarter backers, we are still unable to raise enough money before August. In an environment like the Edinburgh Fringe Festival you cannot rely on ticket sales and so we are currently working towards covering all of our costs before we get to the Fringe. We are doing this by ensuring that we apply for every possible funding outlet possible, both locally and nationally, and launching other crowdfunding initiatives.   \n1376                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Once we have raised the money needed and met our target, we will work tirelessly to promote our show and fill the theatre. We are lucky to have some very competent people helping us creating a campaign worthy of your trust, and support from the Fringe BoxOffice who will feature us in the official programme. We have managed to overcome practical difficulties so far, we've secured a venue, managed to get a poster... Your support will make a very big difference for us!   \n1377                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                From the beginning, this project has been (and will continue to be) about making art. In fact, we've made this show free for all of it's performances, that way we can reach as many people as possible. We don't want anyone to be deterred by having to pay for a ticket, so we've changed the way this project is being funded from other traditional means.People may want to go to theatre and see a play and enjoy a production, even if they can't afford it. This is why we're reaching out to people who are willing to support our cause in putting on this production, so that anyone and everyone who wants to see it, can. Think about it as if you're paying for a friends ticket to the show. That's exactly what you're doing.   \n1378                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           As of today, Emma has dropped off her Registration Documents to the Fringe Festival. This included a $700 participation fee. Emma WILL be in New York in August, despite all the odds. Because she can't afford to lose what she's put into it already. Yes there will be obstacles, but through prayer and dependence on the Father, she knows she will make it there. She has walked out on faith before and been blessed, and she will do it again. The beautiful thing is, she welcomes all to fly to New York and participate in seeing her production with her. She'd love to have you there.   \n1379                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Our venue and time are booked (The Voodoo Rooms, 12:20-1:20am), our accommodation is booked, our train tickets will be booked soon, and our variety acts are being booked as I type!  So far, so good!The biggest challenge will, of course, be audience.  After all, the Edinburgh Fringe Festival is MASSIVE and we will be competing with some absolutely fantastic shows.Hopefully, our time slot will serve us well.  By 12:30am, people will be looking for good variety and entertainment, and we are prepared!  Plus, we spend our days our flyering frantically.  Griffin and Jones will even be on the Royal Mile most days, entertaining crowds with their street shows.  Savannah duPrae will no doubt be with them, prancing around with flyers for everyone!   \n1380                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Here are some of the issues that might arise and how we're going to cope with them!Reduced Technical TimeDue the nature of the Fringe Festival, the amount of time required to set up lighting, sound and set will be much shorter than a show somewhere else would usually have. But this is something all the members of our cast have faced before. Most of us are able to rig lights, program a board and a sound deck and we'll be able to work together to make sure we get the most out of that time.Last-Minute AlterationsC Venues have warned us that there might be a sudden change in venue with a different audience capacity and a different stage size. The nature of the show we're creating is flexible. Whatever stage they throw at us; we'll be able to adapt an ensure that it suits the space as best it can.Lack of rehearsal spaceAlthough we have secured rehearsal spaces in Oxford for the three weeks before the festival begins there's always the chance that something could change with the organisers. Fortunately the show we're creating is flexible enough to be performed anywhere, and that means it can be rehearsed anywhere if we need it to be! There are always spaces around like churches and schoolyards, and if not the gardens, lawns and sitting rooms of our houses will have to suffice.   \n1381                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      We have no high risks.  We've already locked in performance dates at iO.   \n1382                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The challenge is creating an event that can be taken on the road in a rented truck, and be set up quickly and safely - and make a community of the imagination from a group of bystanders. This is not an inflatable - this is the act of inflation and deflation and airpower happening in multiple ways in an uncontrolled environment. We are using new materials and pneumatic systems, and the better we can equip and work out the kinks now, the more people we can get it out to. There is a lot of trial and error in working with new technologies - making an outdoor show that can stand up to weather and be safe, but unexpectedly wild, is a struggle.  We place our bets on a risky and uncontrolled democratic inclusion and the challenge is to explore technology, setting and audience relationships, and our own ridiculous humanity: Help us remain the fools that we are!It’s not easy setting up a 4-story blue-lady wind turbine, or playing a guitar with a gas mask and headtube. And those inflatables aren’t gonna blow themselves up!   \n1383                                                                                     OUR STRETCH GOAL:  $25,000\\nOUR PROJECT:  GIVING OUR PATRONS MORE!!\\nREWARDS/FEES COST:  Cost +/- $2,500The better we do, the more difficult our challenges will be - because not only do our rewards grow exponentially with our backing, but our possibilities will too!  The more our community gives, the more we will give back!  Take the bricks for example - at a low level, we envision but a square.  If we reach our goal - a garden.  If we surpass our goal?  Founder's overlook, or tower, or dare we say, castle?As for the rewards, what if someone comes in at D&D level and lives in Illinois?  What if so many people desire weapons used by our founders that we run out of weapons?  What if our T-shirt makers decide the tri-force is copyrighted and we can't make said T-shirts?Well.  If we can make horses run through fire, we can overcome any measly kickstarter challenge.  You want more battle forged weapons?  We'll get the weapons, and have a battle with them first.  You live in Australia but you REALLY want to play D&D with us?  We'll use the internet magics.  They won't make our T-shirts?  We'll design BETTER T-shirts.  Anything is possible when you say \"yes\" first, and THEN say \"how.\"  We are all in this together, and we always have been -  we relish the chance to rise to a challenge.  Any problem that arises in fulfilling our rewards is a great problem to have - because it means we have met our goal.   \n1384                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   One of the main challenges we face as a company is the sheer size of the ensemble. With 38 cast members going to Edinburgh, Pulse 53 will be the largest company at the Fringe Festival this year. This means that the company's budget has to stretch a lot further than that of a conventional company when it comes to travel and accommodation. However, we believe that with your support we can overcome these obstacles and concentrate on bringing innovative theatre to Edinburgh.   \n1385                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The biggest risks in the Edinburgh Festival is having an awful show in an awful room at an awful time getting awful reviews and everyone feeling awful.Luckily our room is lovely and our timeslot is great - two very important factors at a festival with 2,500 odd shows to compete with - so that's the first two worked out.We're holding multiple workshops over the next two months to make sure the script is in a good place before August. With a fantastic group of actors who bring their own ideas and edits to the table we believe we'll have a tight show that will be the best it can be. So hopefully our reviews won't be awful either. Aside from the above there are still bits more money to raise. We still need to find the cash to print our flyers and posters. However, if this Kickstarter is successful we will have 80% of our production paid for. That puts us in a great place. Edinburgh is happening whether we like it or not. With your support our journey can be much smoother.   \n1386                                                                                                                                                           The main challenge with this project is the development of the show's format. In order to create a truly unique, fluid and entertaining performance, each and every time it is performed, every player needs to be in sync with their colleagues, a feat that takes a lot of time and practice. For this purpose, we will be developing and practising the format during creative rehearsals for a month beforehand.Experience from last years show has taught us that you can never prepare too much, or start too early, and especially as this year we have decided to work with the PBH free fringe which we have never done before, we have taken no liberties with making preparations for this project.As the show is part of the PBH free fringe, the show is completely free and unticketed (though donations are of course welcome), thus we aren't able to necessarily recoup any capital we put into the show, so kickstarter is an excellent way of helping us get some funding to get the show on the road, as it were.Publicising on the Royal Mile is often the best way to promote the show. Talking to people about the show's unique concept and showing our enthusiasm and friendliness often gets people interested. However with so many shows to choose from at the fringe, our eye-catching flyer will remind people of our show and its details so we don't get forgotten!   \n...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ...   \n95664                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Challenges? Well, it's never been done, so we obviously gotta figure some stuff out.  We're feeling cautiously optimistic :)Our biggest risk is doing nothing.  We strongly feel that by bringing people around the country together through a positive common creative cause, which identifies issues in an apolitical way, we can make the America we a live a slightly better (and if nothing else, a little more interesting) place.   \n95665                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I risked some time on this campaign, but it wasn't really a risk because it was fun and what I wanted to do it. So there is no risk - Other than maybe not making all of the heads in time. But maybe nobody will want to have fun and raise a glass to zombies and being outside. If that happens then I still want to make 100 heads so..... Zombie heads are cool, parties are cool, people are cool, Lets see what happens.   \n95666                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         If for any reason we were unable to hold the show on the day as planned, we would simply reschedule for another day!   \n95667                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Of course weather conditions can have effect on developments, to which there is little that anyone can do except wait it out and continue when conditions improve. The plus side of being an experienced artist from London, is that more or less all weather conditions can occur in the same day. Louis seldom lets the weather stop him from completing a days work painting.Damaged camera equipment. if this happens we will have to purchase replacements, fortunately we have some good local camera hire and purchase knowledge in each of the major city destinations. A good insurance policy helps too.The local community take a dislike to the mural. its never happened in all my years painting murals, but if it did i would just paint it back out. Fall off a ladder and break a body part. Again it's never happened before, but if it did, a trip to A&E and a few days rest will have me back at the wall in no time.   \n95668                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Risks are inherit in any project but our risks are minor.  All of our past projects have surpassed our goals and traditionally gone off without a hitch.  We don’t foresee any hiccups with the proposed mural project, but things happen.  One of the biggest risks comes in selecting the artists.  As we look for art pieces that are less “safe” than those already produced, we run the risk that more of the community won’t understand the art and may, dislike it.  However, art is meant to be evocative so that’s a risk we’re prepared to undertake.  If people are talking about the murals, we’ve done our job.  Of course, if funding isn’t achieved, our project will be placed on hold until we can secure funding. Finally, with our proximity to Yellowstone National Park, and the Yellowstone Supervolcano, (around 220 miles north) if an eruption occurs, our community, and therefore our project, is toast!   \n95669                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Once we reach our goal of $1500 and secure the space as our own, we face very little challenges in implementing our ideas. While writing this bio, this question was literally the hardest to answer.The one obstacle that could become very real would be if we were asked to stop distributing the mats to the homeless. Luckily for us there are currently no restrictive laws in Detroit regarding feeding or otherwise helping to shelter the homeless. We take this work very seriously and intend to continue our work no matter the amount of potential red tape thrown at us. We have contacts with the local chapter of the ACLU and would not hesitate to reach out for help should that occur.The materials we use are free, as is the manpower and willingness to distribute our mats. The one very real obstacle we all face is not having our funding goals met and losing access to the space.   \n95670                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       One risk is printing and delivery. Our portraits will be printed at the InsideOut home base in New York. Any delays in delivery mean delays in our installation date.There are also some materials that we'll need that can be difficult to obtain such as city street barriers.We try to be as ecological as possible, so our glue is 100% biodegradable. We plan to provide snacks and water to our volunteers and will try to find the environmental ways such as a refillable water bottle station and home-made goodies! Any volunteers want to bake for us on the day of the installation?Lastly we could also use volunteers to help glue the installations, run the setup, and write about us!   \n95671                                                                                                                                   Every public art project presents opportunities and challenges. Over the past decade and a half I have completed projects across the United States - for museums, sculpture parks and private clients - from the roof of a building in Lexington, Kentucky, to a public park in Sarasota, Florida, to the courtyard of a new development in Seattle, Washington, and a bike and pedestrian path in Cambridge, Massachusetts.My crew and I have endured extreme temperatures, from 10 below to 110.  We have worked in the rain and mud, the snow and cold. We’ve overcome skeptical city employees, equipment failures, late deliveries, and a host of other challenges large and small to complete projects on time and on budget. Every project is different and every project has its surprises, nothing ever goes the same way twice; Which is part of what makes creating public art so much fun. \\n \\nSuccessful projects rely on collaboration between artists, architects, engineers, and contractors, as well as skillful negotiations with clients, city agencies, and community stakeholders.  Working with Artprize, who commissioned “Louis,” my engineers, and Grand Rapids city agencies, we secured all the permissions and permits needed to erect “Louis” on Calder Plaza.  My experience combined with the capable and committed team at Artprize should assure our supporters that Louis will succeed.   \n95672                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              This being our sixth year running PRHBTN we would like to think that we have worked out all of the kinks but there is always a problem or challenge that could arise. In the past we have dealt with last minute venue changes, travel visa delays, missing lifts, last minute paint shortages, lifts sunk in the mud, lack of proper voltage and more minor headaches than we can count. But we always find a way to make it work and we will continue to do so. There is no doubt about that!   \n95673  As an ongoing study in the realm of discard studies and all of its underlying fields, I feel PLAST|C BE/NGS has merely scratched the surface. In that sense, the blogs maintenance is a great means to continue my research, constantly expanding my perspectives on the topic, creating a database for myself and others, as well as, developing a network of people interested in similar practices as I. As for the hands on research with discarded materials, I wish to further develop PLASTICULT on an international level, examining peoples plastic waste and the stories it tells, in different regions of the world.I will continue questioning and exploring the materials and mindset used in the world today. As a creative practitioner and a member of society, I do not want to contribute to the accumulation of useless, toxic waste, massively produced on a daily basis, but want to help re-think the way we perceive things and their lifecycles. I want to support the development and use of healthy, sustainable materials and practices, but also want to figure out ways of repurposing the “not-so-healthy-nor-sustainable”, nonetheless, useful materials we are still producing and consuming massively, on a daily basis. Materials, like plastic, which are here to stay and though, ideally, should cease to be produced in their current forms, once that shift does, indeed, take place, we will still be left with an unfathomable amount of them purposelessly laying around. “For these objects, after all, have ...   \n95674                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The greatest challenge for a successful haunted house is getting all necessary building supplies ahead of time so that the event can be properly planned and executed.  The more donations we get ahead of time, the better we can make use of that resource to design awesomely spooky elements for the event.  We will take into careful consideration our budget for the event and labor to maximize every dollar for the greatest room designs.   \n95675                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    We're trying to do as much of the work as we can using local animators, techies, videographers, electricians, etc... We've got a smart, hardworking group of people that we're confident can get it done--but events can always have unexpected problems pop up.The budget is ambitious and mounting 5 major projections is our goal. We have a solid path to raise the funds but nothing is guaranteed.It could rain! The good news is that we have both Sept 3 and Sept 4 as rain dates   \n95676                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               In the previous Kickstarter, we raised funds for a \"beta test\" - to install a portion of lights on the tracks to troubleshoot vibrations, safety, light durability, and interactivity. We also used it as a way for us to establish a workflow with our partners ILC and Aldridge Electric as well as our city partners. With the beta test up for 9 months now, we know the lights will work, they are not a distraction, the vibrations are negligible, and we've figured out interactivity.The risks and challenges we face now are funding related. This kickstarter will probably not raise the total funds needed to install 2 full blocks of lights. Our goal is to use the kickstarter to create a groundswell of grassroots support to convince corporate, private, and foundational support to join.   \n95677                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Our main challenge is going to be figuring out how to clean up the Poem Booth...removing stickers, debris, and re-painting. We also need to install weatherproof hardware to protect the poem. We will need to monitor the booth to react to any vandalism.We will have an ongoing challenge choosing poems from a large pool of highly qualified local poets.Our collective skills ensure that we can meet these challenges.

For us, this is a project with a clear start and end date.  We have worked with this community to build three structures in the past, and so we have a great deal of confidence in our team and in our ability to persevere even when obstacles arise and things get complicated. Rewards: Making and shipping handmade crafts from Haiti is also challenging. Sometimes things get lost or broken in transit, so patience is required. Each gift is hand made, so some variations are to be expected.   \n95679                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Once accquiring the t-shirts press, SucchiniPrints, faces the risk of trial and error. Having never used a t-shirt press before, it is likely that it will take some time and supplies to get used to. The artist, Suki White, is confident in her abilities and like any other risk or challenge in life, she will approach it head on.   \n95680                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      While we have had multiple installations and exhibitions on our facade and in our lobby, MORE IS MORE has been a challenge from the start, given the scale and complexity of the project.We are confident that the installation will proceed as planned and on schedule, and we have secured all needed city permits and approvals to begin the install in early November.FINE PRINT \\nThe Wolfsonian is using Kickstarter, a third-party online funding platform.

Over the course of 30 years doing this kind of work, I've mastered all the tasks, both from the technical end as well as the community process end, to see a project through from conceptual vision to finished reality. Last year's two projects in Thailand were 100% successful, for me personally and professionally, but more importantly, for the many hundreds of people that worked so beautifully together on them. Although it is never possible to know exactly what the future will bring, we have every expectation that two new mosaics will be borne through joyful, productive community work.   \n95683                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Ben will work throughout the winter hoping to finish (with a public safety certified vessel) by late spring 2017.

Please help us cover that cost.   \n95685                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            On a production/logistical level this project is very solid, since I already have a quote for paper and printing good for 30 days and I have worked with the printshop many times before and never missed a deadline.  If all available rewards at all support levels are claimed, I will be spending a lot of time packing and taking tubes to the post office.  I have planned for this.Since the work in this project is politically sensitive and potentially inflammatory, interference or malicious activity is a possibility, but I trust that Kickstarter's community will largely be a supportive and tolerant audience.   \n95686                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Complex programming allows for our web platform to carry multiple data sets and multiple users. There is always a chance that during the re-coding of the website, using a new server, aspects of the project's functionality will be lost. However through discussion with the Network and our programmers, we believe we are in a strong position to adapt the platform where necessary in this eventuality.   \n95687                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              We have been very thorough in curating the content for this publication & trust that you will enjoy the outcome.The only identified risk is related to the potential delayed printing turn around, which may in turn push the delivery date back a few weeks. If this does take place, we commit to communicating to the respective pledgers immediately with a corresponding ETA for delivery.   \n95688                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The main risk is that the project as a whole doesn't get any funding and the official Ajo Street Art Project 2017 doesn't go ahead. That being said, I have spoken with several collaborators from across the border regions of Arizona and we have agreed that we will make sure an event of some description happens anyway. Hence why we are independently fundraising to enable a community event, as big as the funding allows us. If the funding provided (separately to my own) is pulled, I will go to Ajo and collaborate with Tucson Arts Brigade over the same time frame in March to create a mural. With regards to rewards, I have provided rewards I know I can create within a certain time frame. The originals will be hand painted, and whilst I can of course, adhere to requests - the supply and demand will mean that edits and changes will be kept to a minimum once finished. I cannot afford to create and distribute rewards until the project is fully funded as if the funding isn't met, I will be hugely out of pocket. I do have a strategy in place to create, package and ship all artwork quickly - as this is something I do regularly for my freelance work anyway - so I should be good at this by now! :)   \n95689                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I know what you're thinking - are Elise and Jenny so hard up that they can't just back this silly project on their own without bothering me about it? Well, the answer is more or less, yes. We all want to be creative but unfortunately, justifying it in these tense times is difficult. That's where a lot of small justifications come in- i'm referring to your money. Now, another question you might have - are you really going to start a podcast? Doesn't that take time you usually don't have?While I am usually a very very busy person - this is something that Elise and i have wanted to do for a while. We understand the time commitment and the dedication it will take to produce a top quality show for you all - and we are excited to do it!   \n95691                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          This is a grassroots community funded project. We are relying heavily on the support from Muslims & non-Muslims around the world to make this project a success. Wherever possible, we will draw from our existing networks to help spread the word and push this project off the ground.We are mindful that there is a risk that our campaign might challenge anti-Muslim & conservative Muslim sentiment - the posters may get taken down, pasted over or defaced. Participants are recommended to put up posters in areas where they have received permission, or partner with establishments that support our message.Ultimately, we believe that we can make positive change through story-telling & advocacy.   \n95692                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The risk is us not executing on the sculpture, the weather being terrible etc. \\nWe have been doing this for 20 years though and have always pulled it off. Snow is a temporary medium! The sculpture we made that won the US Nationals in 2012 collapsed an hour after judging  - so the piece really only needs to stand for the hour or so - - so the ability to push the envelope really exists - especially with the piece we are trying to do this year.  We have been talking to engineers about tensile strengths and stress points - so we feel pretty good with our design and just need to do our cold weather dance when we get out there. I think it will looks awesome at night with all the lights.... There is a saying in the snow sculpting world - You have to go thin to win! The real risk is not executing the sculpture to the best of our ability. Your help will take financial worry off our mind. letting us get to where we need to be.   \n95693                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      In producing this project we fully expect to hit our fair share of speed bumps and slow downs. But we’re a scrappy bunch with a combined half century of experience partnering with numerous community organizations, working with the city, and producing public art. Got a project that involved senior immigrants, first generation artists, and grassroots activism? Please turn your attention to our Engaging Artists Residency Program. Do we need to work with three separate government agencies to screen the film in public parks? Yeah, we’ve done that. (What’s up DOT!) Is there the aftermath of a hurricane in the way of exhibiting the work? Yep, Sandy hit right before we presented Abraham Lincoln: War Veteran Projection by Krzysztof Wodiczko in Union Square. With the right combination of pleading and smooth talk we got the job done. \\nBasically what we’re saying is - when the going gets tough - which it will, we become public art ninjas. Trust us.   \n95694                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Working with natural elements such as soil, seeds and weather, always presents a certain amount of unpredictability. But the beauty of these challenges is that, even in failure, they represent an educational opportunity to study the causes and effects of biological systems. And here, we also have the time and space to provide multiple trials.Additionally, many of the musical tools we will be developing during this project have been prototyped during the Music Box Tampa Bay and have undergone rigorous community testing. We are confident in their ability to incite joy.   \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      text_general  \n0      “It's rare for a talented and successful director such as Kate to take the bold step of moving from an Associate position in a well-resourced regional theatre into the precarious territory of fringe producing and directing.  The fact that this is a challenge that Kate is embracing is a testament both to her own vision and to the current potential of the Cardiff fringe scene.”  John McGrath, Artistic Director, National Theatre Wales “Cardiff needs a new producing house of this scale and Kate Wasserberg is exactly the right person to run it. I am very excited by her plans and look forward to them becoming reality.” Tim Price, Playwright. “The Finborough has shown how ‘small theatre’ can create a national impact. That is Kate’s ambition for Cardiff. She has passion, professionalism, talent and an encyclopedic knowledge of Wales and its writers.” Terry Hands, Artistic Director, Clwyd Theatr Cymru\\nYou can visit our website here.

We've been a touring company for 14 years, always dreaming of someday having our own venue.  Through your encouragement and support-- it's finally happening!The hanging sign and window graphics will bring people in.  Your donation will make it happen.  We hope you'll come visit 34 West downtown, get a look at our spiffy sign, and enjoy a show like none other...in the theater you helped create.Thank you!  \n11     Its a Circus show! But right now we cant afford the amazing venue we've confirmed for the 22nd, 23rd and 24th July. http://www.the-vaults.org/#!gallery/ck0qWe also need funding for costumes, lights, set and aerial equipment to make it really happen. Tangerino is our events company that will be putting on the show. We specialise in performance and visual arts. It was set up by Sisters Lil and Kitty Rice early last year. We wanted to find a way of mixing our love of music, art, theatre and Circus and so in June 2013 put on our first show. Our first two shows were a huge success but we did it all on a wing and a prayer AND a shoestring! We are so excited to have started this company and we're really keen to evolve and expand.Kitty and Lil work closely with the artists to create several short ‘acts’. A circus artist or dancer works with a band or musician writing original songs or learning covers to form a forty minute show. This show will feature the amazing Marika Hackman. Lil Rice and Ollie Clark will also be playing While Lil focuses on directing and choreographing the show, Kitty is learning to build sets and organises the aesthetic of the show.We also would like to let you know that this is an ongoing and hopefully long term project. So if we're lucky enough to make our financial goal thanks to all of you, any extra pledges will go into future plans for shows, like The Red Shoes. Please help fund our venture. Please come and see us, we want to meet you and show you what...  \n12     In April of 2012, The 42-year-old professional Equity regional theatre Oldcastle Theatre Company moved into the former Knights of Columbus building on Main Street in downtown Bennington, Vermont. Over the last two years, OTC has done extensive renovations, and converted the building into a working professional theatre. We now have a flexible theatre space, designed for professional theatre productions, as well as concerts, special events and other community functions. We're focused on creating the creative center, where our community experiences theatre, art and music.In addition to its Equity theatre season, in the past year we have established Oldcastle Theatre Downtown Arts, which encompasses programming including concerts, special performances by exceptional theatre artists, and children's performances by Oldcastle Actors' Express. Our community programming has been expanded to include school programs and community education programs with professional theatre arts. We have hit the ground running, and this past year has been amazing --- a year of self-discovery for us and a year of new experiences for our audiences.  Looking to the future, one of the main goals of our renovation project is to make the building accessible to as many people as possible. We've installed a handicap accessible bathroom off the lobby, as well as a state-of-the-art lift located right next to the main door which can bring a physically challenged visitor to the lobby and theatre level, or an ac...  \n13     Since 2009, The New Movement has been hosting a variety of comedy projects in not only New Orleans and Austin, but around the country through all sorts of festivals and tours. We teach improv and sketch comedy writing classes. We host shows all over the city. We produce some of the most unique comedy festivals in the world. In 2011, New Orleans natives Chris Trew and Tami Nelson moved back home from Austin with the intention of putting New Orleans on the comedy map. They opened a small comedy theater and training center in 2011, and they did big things in a short period of time. Here's a video about what TNM was like back then.After 2 years in the small, musty space on Burgundy, The New Movement is proudly expanding our comedy-creating operations to a beautiful, spacious spot at 2706 St. Claude. This move not only allows us to teach more classes, it creates new show slots and seats a larger audience.  Additionally, the TNM community will have access to a podcast recording booth, a video production studio complete with a green screen wall, green room with all the amenities for performers, and classrooms dedicated to both Improv and Sketch Writing. This is a huge step up for our homegrown business and we’re fully committed to make this leap because we believe in our comedy and community. We are proud to be a part of New Orleans' art scene and we hope our presence on St. Claude Avenue will compliment the exciting growth the area is undergoing. And to all TNMers reading this ...  \n1362                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \"Independence\" tells the story of three adult sisters struggling with competing loyalties to themselves and to their mentally unstable mother. It is a unique, funny, honest, and heartbreaking examination of the ways in which our own families can save us but also destroy us. The Hollywood Fringe Festival has provided us the opportunity to share this story--a true Lee Blessing classic, but rarely-produced--with our community. It also marks the directorial debut of Vernée Watson, a veteran professional working actor and an acclaimed acting coach. (You may know her as Will Smith's mom on \"The Fresh Prince of Bel Air\"!)\"Independence\" opens June 6, 2014 at The Lounge Theatre (6201 Santa Monica Blvd.).

It is a piece of 'Epic Theatre' heavily influenced by Bertolt Brecht and has been adapted to fit into the story of the Jungle Book. The play follows Mowgli as she journeys through the jungle in search of the truth about whether Scotland should be independent. The piece uses animals to tell the story in a view to make it more accessible to those who may not understand politics. With the help of Alex Salmond the Tiger and David Cameron the monkey, Mowgli is confronted with the facts and what to do with them. It is a thoroughly upbeat piece including music, singing, dancing and poetry.The Three Mugs of Tea are a new theatre company who met and work together at the Liverpool Institute of Performing Arts. There are four members at present and we are taking The Jungle referendum to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It is a non- biased piece that is relevant to an English,Welsh, Irish and Scottish audience and highlights the importance of the vote.   \n1364   Poly Bunker Sings, the new play from Sly Fortress Productions, really is all of those things. The one thing it definitely isn't is a play in which Poly Bunker Sings. In fact, Poly Bunker isn't even in the play. ABOUT THE SHOWThe play consists of three short vignettes. The first gives us a glimpse into the lives of four people who live together in a polyamorous household, and experience all the pleasure and (mostly) pain that comes along with it. That's Poly.The second vignette explores what happens when we lock two people in a bunker with little to do but \"get to know\" each other. If Rod Serling and Harold Pinter had a baby, we hope it would look something like Bunker.Finally, a wide-eyed hillbilly from Amite County, Mississippi sings her way through the mean streets of Los Angeles hoping to find her dreamboat, Tom Hanks. With original music composed and performed by Rana Rines as the innocent Darlene (pronounced Darlin') we wrap up the show with Sings.So there you have it. Poly. Bunker. Sings.For more info on polyamory, start with this article.WHY WE'RE HEREWe have the script (we wrote it). We have the actors (we hired ‘em). We have the venue and four dates in June. What we need now is a little help to fund the show. The money we raise will help with many things, including marketing, prop acquisition, set pieces, and venue rental for rehearsals and performances. But MOST importantly - it will help us pay our actors, musicians and crew!Rana Rines and David Harper, the cre...  \n1366   The 2014 United Solo Festival (unitedsolo.org) committee has accepted us! Yay!!! The festival houses solo performances for 8 weeks and we have been invited to present \"Is It Feasible?\" on October 18th at Theatre Row Studios on 42nd Street. That means we have a theatre and a time slot to premiere the show in New York City and the rest is up to us.We have been creating, shaping, and evolving this show since July of 2013. Without the amazing support of patrons, mentors, fellow artists, and the media, we never would have gotten to this point. We now have an opportunity to expand our audience and continue the growth of this show while still chasing our mission to introduce the uniqueness of the Bulgarian culture to the American stage.\\n\\nBased on four short stories by Bulgarian humorist Chudomir, Zlatomir Moldovanski takes us to 1965 where we see bureaucrat Petar Petrovkov welcome the hardworking Bulgarian villagers into civilized city life. This tragic hero shares and recounts the beauties and misconceptions with which our dreams were once filled.With a wonderful sense of urgency and passion we learn to accept the communal desire to be accepted. This piece provides a taste of the Bulgarian sensibility and humor in a completely honest fashion that Americans, Bulgarians and everyone can relate to and enjoy.Here are some reviews:http://arts.heraldtribune.com/2014-02-25/featured/theater-review-actor-brings-a-bulgarian-flair-to-is-it-feasible/http://www.thebradentontimes.com/news/...  \n1367   Any donation, big or small, will be hugely appreciated! It's imperative we raise £1,000 to take 'Bloom' to the Fringe, but the overall cost will be much greater than this so we are looking to raise as much as possible.Vocal Point theatre company was founded in 2013 by Abraham Parker and Robert Scobie. Their production 'Bloom' concerns poverty in Glasgow and those affected by it. It is being developed from conversations with regulars at the Glasgow City Mission, a soup kitchen in the heart of the city. The project focuses on two narratives uncovered in these conversations, initiated through volunteering at the Mission. The culmination will be a 50-minute performance, a piece of visual storytelling inspired by the two tales. One man, Anthony, tells the story of a tragic event that affected him and his family at a young age, paving the way for an impoverished life without a home. The other, Michael, begins his journey on the streets of southern Los Angeles. By way of Dublin, Amsterdam and finally Glasgow, he recounts his battles with mental health issues, crises of confidence, gang related crime and eventually time behind bars.'Bloom''s stories will be accompanied by a live soundscape and an array of live images. Through this blend of image, sound and narrative, the production will reinstate the tales of two fascinating individuals and their plight.\\n\\nAvoiding a didactic approach to socially conscious theatre, it will reflect the cyclic, hereditary and, at times, contagious...  \n1368   \\nRuddy Productions is committed to utilizing the creative process for inspiring, nurturing and empowering artists. We are a company of intensely-trained actors who strive to be first-rate artists, eternally committed to our craft and to truthfully examining the human experience. We are eager to create new opportunities for like-minded artists, in order to encourage and feature their talents and artistry. Our company is dedicated to fostering an environment of collaboration and community, which we believe will translate into authentic, captivating experiences for our audiences.Ruddy Productions began in June 2013, just a few months after the company members graduated from the 2 year acting conservatory Maggie Flanigan Studio in NYC. The Maggie Flanigan Studio gave us the crafting, the confidence and the vision that we all strive for as actors. Towards the end of our time at the Maggie Flanigan Studio, we discovered that one of the strongest resources we had as emerging artists was each other. We started meeting weekly this past February and decided a new work festival would be our first creative endeavor. We then reached out to our first of many collaborators, the writers. We received over 250 written submissions from talented, up and coming writers from all over the country! After we had our submissions, we began our reading process and started to involve our 2nd integral group of collaborators, our directors. However, we are still in need of the support from our 3rd int...  \n1369   \"ROMEO AND JULIET IN HELL\" is a one act comedy about the titular  famous lovers who wake up in their Personal Hell, forced to listen to Tony from WEST SIDE STORY sing \"Maria.\"  For Eternity.  Their only way out is to endure watching their life story performed by the other inhabitants of Hell - Shakespeare's dead characters: Hamlet, Lady Macbeth, Othello, Desdemona, et al.  \"ROMEO AND JULIET IN HELL\" goes up at the Complex Theatre's Flight Theatre on June 13, 14, 15, 21, 22 and 28 for the 2014 Hollywood Fringe Festival!I've wanted to produce this play for almost two decades and my friend (and cast member!) Rebecca Lane suggested that the Fringe would be the perfect testing ground.  And she was right. Producing and directing \"R&J IN HELL\" feels like the culmination of years of seemingly disparate projects:  I've directed a number of  comedies in L.A., I've taught Shakespeare here for years, and I produced my full-length thriller \"NEVERMORE\" in 2011.  Bringing all of that experience into finally producing the first play I ever wrote - a comedy about Shakespeare -  is like coming full circle. And by the way, my cast is brilliant and hysterical.The show features Luke Wesley Baldridge, Gail Friedland, Andy Kenareki, Michael Onofri, Eusebio Hernandez, Nick Ley, Rebecca Lane, Tamara Rhoads, Schoen Hodges, Chairman Barnes, Kevin Swanstrom, Wisam Mubasher and Tim Astor.  There's only so much the written word can do, and these seasoned (to perfection!) professionals take a funny pre...  \n1370                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Cries of Freedom and The Walk of Freedom are in their seventh year of production. We offer our events free to the public every year during the 4th of July week as part of America's Freedom Festival at Provo. All cast members, staff and presenters are strictly volunteer. Our company, Roots of Freedom, sponsors the event and tries to make it better every year. The purpose of our events is found in our mission statement: \"Roots of Freedom educates and inspires youth, families, and all citizens to understand, respect, and preserve for future generations the values, freedoms, and ideals established by the Founding Fathers and fundamental documents of the United States of America.\"This year we are buying tents, adding to our sound equipment and making more costumes. We receive some money from the Freedom Festival and our local CARE Tax but it is not enough to fund the growth of our event. We need your help to keep our event free of charge again this year. AND...we are offering some really cool gifts that will make your donation totally worth it!We hope you will support us in this great community project to preserve our God-given freedoms!  \n1371                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Our production is a curiously dark adaptation of Bram Stoker’s original story of ‘Dracula’.

As well as winning The Scotsman ‘Fringe First’ and a ‘Fringe Review Award’ for ‘excellence’ and ‘outstanding theatre' The Paper Birds have been shortlisted for The Stage’s ‘Best Ensemble’, Total Theatre’s ‘Best Young Company’ and The Amnesty International ‘Freedom of Expression' Award.Over the past 11 years The Paper Birds have gained a solid reputation for ‘giving voice to the voiceless’ through our repertoire of 10 touring productions. The Paper Birds strive to create and share devised work that is important; work that is culturally, socially and politically observational and conversationally urgent. The Paper Birds productions will always emerge from a female perspective and often this female voice will prioritise stories of women.The company’s work will often shift and reinvent itself to address and evoke discussion, thought and emotion when and where it is most needed whilst retaining the company's signature visual and physical approach.“The Paper Birds are expert theatre makers. They have their own trademarks, unearthing young women’s stories on hard-hitting themes through verbatim material and subtle movement.” Total Theatre“Leeds-based devising company Paper Birds have more brilliance in th...  \n1375                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Help first time producer Emily Hubert mount this ambitious project; Old Vic New Voices and Eastenders:E20 writer Alex Oates's first staged play 'Silk Road' directed by emerging director Dominic Shaw.  \n1376   BEYOND THE CRINGE - 10 British Playwrights who should have got out moreBored?

They discussed their ideas with some of their friends at RADA and Birkbeck College, and shortly were joined with Victoria Gimby, Catherine Day, Angela Kim, Andreas Andreou and Alex Baines. Together we sat down, and got to work - The show isn't going to write itself! Our brand new show BEYOND THE CRINGE is an affectionate stunning and slaughtering of ten British Playwrights who we feel should have got out more: We'll offer a new witty and irreverent take on authors such as Samuel Beckett, Sarah Kane, John Osborne, Simon Stephens. In order to be able to showcas...  \n1377                                                                                                                                           Scooter Thomas Makes it to the Top of the World is a timeless play written by Peter Parnell. Written as Parnell's first notable work, Scooter reflect's how life changes from adolescence into adulthood. Rarely do we turn into the people we expect to be, or do the things we expect to have done. How we view our successes or failures vary drastically between people, and that's what makes us reminiscent, nostalgic, regretful, and most likely, makes us change the way we behave in the future.Scooter lets us see two very different world views about what it was like growing up, and what it means for us to \"make it to the top of the world.\" How do we measure success as humans? What would you want to do if you died tomorrow? What would you regret not doing? Were you \"successful?\" Scooter shows us all a variation of what it was like entering the real world, and what it would've been like if we never got the chance.Our small and mighty group of creatives have dedicated their own time, effort, and money to put on this project, regardless of it's success on kickstarter. We are reaching out for support for a project we've already dedicated ourselves too. The success of our kickstarter will in turn be dedicated to bolstering the scope of advertising, increasing production value (although it would never be less than professional), and getting people in seats.  \n1378                                                       Emma's edgy one woman show, mislabeledilEMMA: No, I Don't Have Downs Syndrome had it's first success premiering in LA in February. She has now been accepted and given the opportunity to take her show to New York in the New York International Fringe Festival from August 8-24.Financially, this requires quite a lot! She has to pay for flights for those involved in production (herself and her director), she has to secure a place to stay, and she's gotta eat while she's there! She also has additional payments for the venue/crew of her show, and technical aspects she needs to successfully perform her production.This is a once in a lifetime opportunity, and since God has clearly provided thus far, she doesn't see why finances have to get in the way! Artists like Mindy Kaling, John Leguizamo, and Whoopi Goldberg have started great careers doing solo shows. Emma's show deals with many different topics. She talks of two syndromes, Nail Patella and Downs. She also deals with issues such as discrimination, gender equality, racism, religion, fitting in with society, and finding your identity. This show, if performed in New York, could lead to other awesome things! Including a Christmas show in South Carolina, or even campus tours at Universities later down the road with paneled discussion.Emma firmly believes that all things are possible with God, and that she has been given her gift of writing and humor for a reason. Maybe this is it!   \n1379   After spending eighteen months conquering Guildford and London, The Lock-In Cabaret has set our sights on Edinburgh.

The stories are going to be presented in an entirely new light with a continuing narrative centred on childhood memory and the danger of forgetting. The Grimm Fairy Tales meets 'Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind'. A girl wakes up with no idea of who she is. No memories. No identity. At the GRIMM Institute; they're very good at what they do. GRIMM follows the journey of a lost soul clinging on the strands of her identity, desperately trying to piece together her past. Hansel and Gretel, Red Riding Hood and other stories are weaved together in an entirely new way, so as to become signposts on her journey towards self-discovery. We're working closely with a physical theatre actress and practitioner  to create an intensely physical, original and dynamic piece which promises to be beyond any standard student production. We have the venue: we have been confirmed for performing on the mainstage of C too (155 seats!). We have the cast: some of the most exciting and experienced actors from the student body have come together for this. We have the vision: Hypnotist Theatre have never disappointed. Our standards get higher and higher with each performance, and this is no exception. FURTHERMORE 50% of all our profits are going to CANCER RE...  \n1381                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Please help us reach our goal of $1,500 in order to produce our original play, \"Shock Treatment\" for the Hollywood Fringe Festival this June.Last year, a group of us put up \"Matt & Ben\" at the Hollywood Fringe Festival and it did wonders for all of our careers.  In Los Angeles, we've found you have to create your own projects in order to get noticed.  \"Your own path,\" as they say.  This year, we had to raise money in order for us to put our best foot forward-- to have the best venue, costumes, cast, and to most importantly, reach as many people as we can.  We greatly appreciate your help.  When you come see the show, we guarantee you will have a good time!   Thank you!!!\"Shock Treatment\"....Written by Mackenzie Yeager, Directed by Jud Williford, Starring Amanda Foreman, Mackenzie Kyle, Andy Hill, Bryan Rogers, & Dan Torson.Music By Andy Hill & Mackenzie Yeager, Produced by Alex Reed.   \n1382   Squonk’s Pneumatica will celebrate air and wind\\npower with a new outdoor musical spectacle.Project DescriptionWe want to make a new free touring event:\\nPneumatica will be made of air, powered by air, and about air.

The company place an emphasis on creating exciting, experimental, devised theatre. Each member of the company has a unique view on theatre through training in Europe at such establishments as RESAD (Madrid), AMU (Prague), Institut Del Teatre (Barcelona), ESAD (Murcia), EMTA (Tallinn) and VSMU (Bratislava); this means the company are able to call in to play a wide variety of techniques to create theatre that pushes boundaries and creates new mediums. The International nature of the European Theatre Arts course and the diversity within the ensemble means that Pulse 53 have an eye for creating theatre which incorporates inter-disciplinarity; and as such aims to create innovative theatre within a European context.AGAINST NOTHINGNESS or 3cm ABOVE AN EMPTY HEADThe company's first show was created in collaboration with Andrzej Wełmiński and Teresa Wełmińska, two of the original members of Tadeusz Kantor's; Cricot 2, a Polish experimental theatre company founded in 1955. Developed as part of the European Theatre Arts course at Rose Bruford College, the piece emerged from an investigation into the process of memory as a means for creating theatre, in this case specifically the memories of Witkiewicz. The production puts a 21st century spin on practices that were prevalent in the construction of 20th century European Avant-Garde theatre.  \n1385   We're taking a new play to Edinburgh this year. We're ticking along nicely but could really use your help with the last few financial hurdles. Namely, a venue instalment that is due in for mid-June.For this show we're at a venue called Just the Tonic, which is where Tom and I created Poets' Corner in 2009. That play had sell-out shows and transferred to Austria. It's the first time we're working together again since then, so we hope to repeat the success.With your £500 we'd be in a much easier position to spend money on other parts of the show. With venue rent out of the way we can spend the cash we save on the production itself. So anything you can give would go a long way.The show is called Red Jungle Fowl. It's a comedy about students going to Sao Paulo in 2014 football mania attempting to show the youths of Brazil that acting can be their way to empower themselves. The characters delude themselves into thinking they can \"make a difference\", but when a girl goes missing the futility of the tour is thrown into light. Tom and I are drawing from experiences we had with our school tour to Brazil seven years ago. Whilst the aim of that tour was very different (nobody was under the illusion we were changing lives - unlike the characters in this play - and nobody went missing) what we did find was how much it was us, rather than the proverbial \"them\", who learnt and benefited.Instead this play is an exaggerated vision, and a satire on self-indulging charity and voluntourism, ...  \n1386   Following the success of last year’s Death by Murder, the Red Herrings return with a brand new show!

We’re home to large murals, sculptures and a unique “art underground” gallery. Since our first foray into public art with a large mural in the fall of 2014, we haven’t slowed down and are picking up speed.    \\n The first mural was commissioned on a city-owned building that long sat vacant. Occupying a wall approximately 126 feet long by 24 feet high, the mural by artist Valerie Doshier was reflective of our landscape. \\nQuickly following up on that mural, we rolled out our next project – the Art Underground Gallery. The Art Underground Gallery transformed a dark, uninspired pedestrian underpass into a lively art gallery with 25 original art pieces by local artists of all ages.  \\n\\n In the summer of 2016, we commissioned graffiti artist Ryan “ARCY” Christenson to complete a piece on the back of a building along 5th Street. Titled “Ambition Within,” the piece is hugely popular and brought a renewed interest in the arts to Rock Springs.  \\n\\n We’re also working on an interactive public art piece on a vacant lot at the corner of M and North Front Streets. We anticipate selecting the artist for this piece in October for a spring 2017 unveiling.  \\n\\n With the momentum we’ve garnered over the past 2 years, we’re looking to add more murals to our public art program. We’ve identified roughly one dozen potential locations, with more to come.  \\n\\n With our funding goal, we hope to add at least 2 n...  \n95669  We are 4 local female artists raising money to ensure our place in a larger artist enclave, The Russell Industrial Center, located in downtown Detroit. The funds raised would go toward the security deposit, and some repairs to broken windows, repair and repaint the floor, attach a safety guard rail to the loft, and install internet in the studio. Currently we are in the process of having the lease shifted from the previous owner into our names. The only thing holding us back is the neccesary $1,500.The 4 of us have set our sights on a very vulnerable section of our community; the homeless located in the downtown areas of Detroit. We hear about homelessness and are given statistics, numbers that essentially do nothing to increase our comprehension of this very real crisis unfolding before our eyes. As people using a space in Detroit this is a very real situation that we see daily. Every doorway on every side street occupied by a person trying to sleep or get out of the elements. Street after deserted street engulfed in tents, wet blankets, garbage bags filled with the little possessions these people have left. The struggle that these individuals face is very real, and as we start to approach the winter season, their living situations become even more tenuous then they were before.Our project to help the homeless offers a twofold boon to the communities we serve, as we use free materials gathered from local retailers that are used in the shipping and distribution of their g...  \n95670                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Hello, My name is Jay Han.\\n\\nMyself and three university undergrads are heading an art project in which we are installing 550 black and white portraits (34\" by 53\") on Sept. 22 at Village-au-pied-du-courant and on Sept. 24th at Parc Jean Drapeau. The project is a social project as well as an artistic one and highlights the issue of government budget cuts in university funding. The portraits are of students and it stands to remind people not to look at us as a statistic, and rather relate to us as people through these images. This aims to represent the diversity and unity of students that can call Quebec their home and whom are all affected at different degrees by the lowering of Quebec's education quality and cuts in funding.\\n   \n95671  Louis, one of four Featured Public Projects commissioned for Artprize 8 and named after Louis Campau, the founder of modern Grand Rapids in 1826 will be a pavilion like structure that the viewer can enter. Designed specifically for Vandenberg plaza, a setting that puts my organic formalism– massive in scale but also soft and airy, imposing yet light – into positive dialogue with the iconic modernist aesthetics and architecture of Vandenberg Plaza. From inside, the cell-like structure will frame views of the sky overhead, the surrounding plaza, and Calder’s La Grande Vitesse.  As an artist working in the public realm, I am honored to have my work adjacent to Calder’s emblematic sculpture, the first public art work commissioned under the auspices of the then fledgling National Endowment for the Arts in 1969. Louis builds on the formal and conceptual language established in my 2014 sculpture Odin. Supported by the Picker Interdisciplinary Science Institute at Colgate University, software and engineering tools were developed with Daniel Bosia and team at AKT II in London, and refined by Paul Kassabian at SGH. Our original research addressed computational and structural questions from theoretical (mathematical) virtual (digital) and practical (sculptural) perspectives. Rather than using existing digital tools to “solve” a problem, we built our own tools that allowed us to find problems, to generate new forms and new ways of thinking. These new tools allow me to “pack” circles ...  \n95672  PRHBTN has never been anything more than two people who came together and wanted to put on a street art festival for the city of Lexington.  Over the years so many people have helped us realize that vision but PRHBTN as an organization has remained small. We are still just two people and countless volunteers working together to do something cool.Each year we invite artists that we think are amazing and then try to find a way to pay for it all. In the past we have begged, borrowed, and pleaded with friends, family, local businesses, and complete strangers in order to make it work. We love putting on PRHBTN every year and we would probably sell a kidney on the black market to make it happen but we hope you won't force us to do that.The last two years we used Kickstarter and asked everyone if they could find a few extra dollars to contribute and the project was a complete success! We have cut costs this year and only need to raise $10,000. These funds go towards travel, lodging, supplies, and hospitality for our visiting artists.  Every single cent pledged to this campaign will go directly towards funding these public murals.Tax Information: All donations are tax deductible.  The funds go through LexArts who have graciously agreed to be our fiscal agent which allows your donations to be tax deductible.

For my final project I \"kinda\" need your help. You can get to know more about what I am up to and how you can support me, below. (If you've read this far, don't give up now =) It won't take more than 5 minutes (promise!) and its for a great cause... Thanks in advance for your time and attention!) Plastic shares with humans the adaptability to change in its environment and the quality of being easily shaped or molded. In that sense, I not only use discarded plastic as a building material, but also, make use of “plasticity” to transform the way we perceive daily discarded material and its effects on our surroundings and ourselves – changing environments, creating situations, molding interactions, deforming thoughts and actions. What are my questions; peoples questions about waste, as an ecological problem, a process, as a category of rejected material goods, as a mentality, as a judgment, as an infrastructural and economic challenge, as a political risk, a site for power conflicts or a source of creativity (Liboiron, M.). Ultimately, what are potential answers? What are the diverse possibilities people, including myself, are coming up with, in response to the current scenario? PLAST|C BE/NGS output takes two forms: first, a blog (plasticbeings.tumblr.com) where I compile a major part of my ongoing research and collect different – many times conf...  \n95674                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Last year, The Village Fine Arts Association’s The Suzanne Haskew Arts Center (VFAA’s The SHAC)\\n\\ntransformed its 3,700 square foot industrial space from a community arts center into a frightening\\n\\n“Gallery of the Disturbed” haunted house which was attended by hundreds, thereby launching the\\n\\norganization’s newest annual holiday event. Over 250 volunteers helped a core planning\\n\\ncommittee organize, design, build, and execute the event, and everyone involved was thrilled with\\n\\nthe results. Now, plans are well underway to bring The Haunted SHAC back to downtown\\n\\nMilford for an even bigger and better event, including not only a haunted house at the arts center,\\n\\nbut also a horror film festival at Milford Cinema!  All contributions will go to this campaign for the purchase of building supplies, costumes and make up, special effects, and everything else necessary to pull off a great haunted house.This year's event will span five days over two weekends, and we've nearly doubled the amount of rooms and scares in the design.

Additional support from Matthews Auto and the City of Binghamton.]They set about convincing government officials, business owners and local residents that they should help--that it was a great idea for Binghamton. Powerful projectors were placed in people's downtown lofts to illuminate buildings across the street. Days were taken off of work.All told, 25,000 people came to see the first festival in a city of 45,000. LUMA featured 6 major animations on 5 buildings, with dozens of artists participating. LUMAx highlighted the work of independent artists showcasing their own ideas.On 9/2/16, LUMA is going bigger. The KickStarter will help fund 3 major new initiatives that couldn't happen without your help.- For the first time, LUMA will feature a live, 48 piece orchestra synchronized with a projection mapping themed around the BC Comic Strip.- LUMA launches its juried competition this year, inviting animators from around the world to try out their best ideas on a 4 story bu...  \n95676  The Wabash Lights were born out of a question: can we create the biggest piece of public art in Chicago's history - a piece that is created by the public?The Wabash Lights is an art installation of light fixtures on the underside of the elevated train tracks on Wabash Avenue in Chicago, Illinois. Using over 24,000 programmable light emitting diodes (LEDs) to transform an iconic piece of Chicago infrastructure and history, The Wabash Lights will create a publicly accessible canvas for a dynamic, interactive and creative experience that will in turn re-energize Wabash Avenue and redefine the Chicago Loop.Once fully installed, The Wabash Lights will be programmable by anyone with a phone through app or text; the first work of public art to marry light, technology and community. The above prototype video demonstrates how anyone will be able to text the lights to change colors. This is just the beginning of what The Wabash Lights will be able to do!In August 2015, we successfully raised $60,000 through Kickstarter to install The Wabash Lights Beta Test. The Beta Test has given us the opportunity to test the lights, troubleshoot challenges and promote the lights. We are returning to Kickstarter again because it's important to us that The Wabash Lights be seeded by the public. Public art is often created by one, paid for by few, but meant for everyone. We want to reverse that notion and bring the voice of the people that will enjoy and experience The Wabash Lights into our effor...  \n95677                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Throughout the country, phone booths have been abandoned by major telephone companies who can no longer afford to maintain them. Typically the phone is ripped out of the booth, leaving the abandoned structure for local residents to either demolish or transform. We have adopted a defunct phone booth located on the Forest Street side of the Downtown Bellingham Community Co-op as a potential site for renewed communication in the present day. Right now, the booth is being used for an informal conversation of sorts using graffiti and stickers; we envision to expand upon this by transforming it into a site for a curated exchange of poetic language. As community members browse the nearby reader board for community information, they can also peruse the poem booth for a little brightness, beauty, and inspiration.\\n\\n Our simple goal: To create something that enhances and promotes community.  \n95678  Update: Note to international bidders: to control shipping costs, we've limited shipping of some items to the United States.

This structure is also a communal work of art and architecture – it will involve local teachers, farmers, artists, architects, and school kids in every aspect of its creation.Last month, Hurricane Matthew brought more destruction to a place that has already suffered so much. As Haiti disappears from the daily headlines, the need for long-term economic recovery only grows. Please join us in providing good jobs and building something beautiful.Konbit Shelter was started by artist Caledonia Curry (Swoon) after the devastating 2010 earthquake. In the months after the quake our team of artists, architects, engineers, and builders worked with locals to create a disaster-resilient community center for the village. Together, we went on to construct two single-family homes that combined traditional materials with modern building technologies, and that were crafted with careful attention to detail, form, and light.We want to continue this collaboration with the community by building a third house, this time using bamboo. The house is for Louisiana Pierre Louis and her family of five.

Out of place? Out of touch? Too fat? Too skinny? Too ugly? Too all of the above and more?A whole lot of people feel this way and don’t bring these feelings up because they don't want to seem like a bother.What these people don’t realize is that it’s ok to feel this way, most people feel this way.Feeling this way is exactly what artist, Suki White, bases her work around. Suki’s artwork is relatable and shines a light on the problems in our society that are not talked about enough. If more people talked about our everyday mental health and body image problems then they would feel less like problems. Talking normalizes and normalizing makes us feel more human.This is why Suki and I want to raise $500 - to get people talking.You might be asking yourself…\"how are they going to get people to start talking with $500?”.The answer is simply, a t-shirt press.Getting people to start talking is always the first step in solving a problem and that is what we are trying to accomplish. Being able to physically wear a conversation starter about mental health or body positivity will make a huge difference in the way we view those two matters.The stigma around mental health is atrocious. Those who suffer from mental health problems are are taught to hide their issues because in America if you can not see the problem with your eyes - then the problem should not exist. Help me make America see the problem!  \n95680  With contemporary artist Christie van der Haak, The Wolf is dreaming big this fall! Christie will develop unique textile and batik-inspired patterns to transform the museum’s façade and lobby, and her vibrant vision will be extended with nightly projections of additional geometric designs in vivid color. On view for almost seven months, MORE IS MORE is a bold, contemporary response to our next major exhibition, Modern Dutch Design, and will be the largest public artwork on view during Art Basel Miami Beach/Miami Art Week 2016. Join us in making this dream a reality—and in return, we’ll send you some amazing, specially-designed rewards and unique experiences that will bring you closer to the art. When you show your support, you not only get to help us realize this dynamic public project, but you’ll also be able to take home Christie's bold designs in the form of postcards, scarves, tote bags, and more.

It is a cultural platform for sharing information and engaging with children and adults alike. Common Knowledge advocates for an increased awareness of our natural environment while promoting the idea that plant knowledge should exist as common knowledge. This project is rooted in \"green\" philosophies, alternative pedagogies, nutritional activism and the principles of a gift economy. With our ever-increasing interest in alternative and natural healing, Common Knowledge intends to propagate conversations around our ages-old symbiotic relationship with the plant world, which provides us with physical, mental, emotional and spiritual sustenance. Common Knowledge will operate regionally and has started its journey by showcasing plants found in every urban environment in the northeastern US. These species are strong and resilient and actively work to restore nutrients to damaged city soil. They become an example of nature's endurance and perseverance against great odds. Perhaps they can help guide us to do the same. All Illustrations and art work were drawn from edible plants found in Brooklyn, NYIn short we want to:1. To bring knowledge of plants and their stories back into the realm of Common Knowledge.2. To explore t...  \n95682  My name is Joshua Winer.

Luckily Ben managed to save it from sinking upon numerous occasions! Eeek! Determined to succeed he rebuilt, restored and extended the vessel using only reclaimed materials that were either donated or salvaged from skips.Four years on and The Piano Raft has just reached it's 100th mile near Skipton. Over this time Ben has built his living quarters on board and developed the structure of the raft in various ways. The Captain is now ready to announce the future development plans of The Piano Raft, and I'm pleased to announce, through Kickstarter, his dream...- The Piano Raft Theatre - £3000 is the minimum Kickstarter amount for the Captain to create 'The Piano Raft Theatre Workshop Area'. This funding will allow Ben to build a floating workshop space. This will be used to construct and develop the larger dreams for the theatre on board. The money will go towards building tools and specific construction materials to create this new floating space. Ben will still continue to use reclaimed wood, glass and unusual stray objects, but some materials are simply a little too tricky to find abandoned by the side of the canal. The money will also go towards wheelchair access and will help cover licensing costs, insurance and safety check of th...  \n95684                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            As the co-owners of ghost tactical and RGHNCK, and business partner of Michael Kasey.

I want to make these beautiful design pieces that people will want to keep, but if I can raise the funds to print enough of them, I can make each poster inexpensive enough that plenty of them will get pasted up in public. These are really classic political posters in that they are printed in four solid spot colors rather than process CMYK, so they will have that punchy, graphic, propaganda look. I’m printing them offset litho with soy based ink on recycled warm white paper.  It’s 24 text stock, so it’s thin enough to wheatpase, but stiff enough to also put on your wall or in a frame.

Through art, the social sciences and broadcast radio the network are currently exploring sites within Romania, Britain, Indonesia, Germany and Bulgaria. The collective reach of our project extends from India, Australia, America, France, The Netherlands; in total twenty-one sites in 15 countries are represented by the project!     Since 2015 a series of attacks upon our collective online hub www.wasteland-twinning.net, including a hack from a group claiming to represent the violent fundamentalists Daesh, have brought our online platform down.

Now more prominent than ever, the project - a coming together of artists, diverse in culture, disciplines and practice - started on the intersection of three nations, the United States, the Tohono O'odham Nation and Mexico. Find out more about the small border town of Ajo in these articles by Deborah Fallows for The Atlantic;http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2015/03/ajo-arizona-part-1-a-small-town-pushed-to-the-brink/388976/ http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2015/04/ajo-oasis-in-the-desert/389051/Why do it? Public art is an incredible way of bringing communities together and starting a conversation. Communities in the USA and Mexico border regions need support now more than ever. An international assortment of freelance muralists, Ajo Street Art Project alongside Tucson Arts Brigade are determined to raise enough funding to create large scale murals across the historic border town walls and host a several day event in the centre of Ajo. The aim is to provide Ajo with artists to occupy and decorate the buildings in this unique place in the Sonoran Desert. The project is a framework for larger national and international dialogue to promote socially engaged practice and community based arts.\\n \\nI believe street art enhances its own surroundings and provides an opportuni...  \n95689                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Elise is a pop culture guru and I am but a mere admirer. Together we have come up with a really fun idea for a podcast. Here's the catch -it turns out that podcasts that don't have a nice mic set up ($120) a phantom power supply ($100 industry term) don't really sound like anything worth listening too. We want to do this right so our creative take on pop culture and our childhood's can coalesce together on the air waves without a bunch of garbled sound (i'm referring to the type of sound we can afford right now.)So lend us a creative hand in this venture and help us make our podcasting dream a reality!  \n95691                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         WHO\\n\\n\\n We are a group of Muslims around the globe dedicated to ending 2016 on a positive note with a campaign to celebrate Muslim diversity. \\n WHY\\n We want to equalise media coverage of Muslims with diverse and genuine stories because Muslims come in all colours, shapes and sizes. Some are conservative or traditional, others are progressive or liberal and there are variations in between. No one person has the right to say who is or isn't a Muslim. We all have our unique relationship with our faith which defines our identity. HOW   We know that there are many Muslims and non-Muslims who support the commonality of this cause. Now, more than ever, the world needs to hear positive Muslim voices. We call for our Muslim family to grab a poster and share their personal reflection on \"WHAT BEING MUSLIM MEANS TO ME\" under the tag #WAYS2BMuslim and #(your location)To all our friends, this campaign is a way to stand with us!- Any extra funds will be spent on printing more posters.         \n95692  We are a group of friends who have been sculpting snow together since 1999. In some combination or form we have won 10 or 11 state events, have placed second in the US National event twice, won the US National award in 2012, and won the Gold Medal last year at the International Competition in Breckenridge CO. We are headed back to defend our title! We are representing the USA and the state of Vermont. We are one of 3 US teams. There are 18 teams from all over the world.This is a self funded endeavor - We are all artists and have little capital. Alex and I have young businesses, Brooke just had his second child and Adrian is a Community Art Gallery Director.Adrian and I made up a board game once called “Diddly Squat” - where the object was to be broke but happy. One of the jobs in the game was Community Art Gallery Director.We need your help to pay for new tools and travel - this will cover only some of the total expenses. The luggage alone for the four of us is over 500 bucks. We have to carry chisels, saws and enough tools to carve a 22 ton block of snow into a piece of art. It’s like a construction site - scaffolding - ladders - we need a lot of tools to make this happen! And besides the airfare there are innumerable expenses to make something like this happen. New blades for the scrapers, We ripped the crap out of our snowboard bag last year so we need a new one. We have to make a bunch of really big smoothers for this sculpture.

As the refugee crisis worsens and xenophobia reaches an even higher pitch, NYsferatu draws a parallel between unfounded fears and nationalistic attitudes. The story of Dracula -  depicted in NYsferatu  - is historically told from the perspective of the insider and never of the other. NYsferatu flips the script, creating a platform for our immigrant neighbors to tell the story of how xenophobia affects them and how common perceptions are all too often harmfully inaccurate. Taking the first step in this lengthy process, Mastrovito and a team of artists, will hand animate Friedrich W. Murnau's seminal 1922 film Nosferatu, itself an adaptation of Bram Stoker's story, Dracula.\\nUsing the technique of rotoscoping, each character, gesture, and expression will be redrawn in the original film’s classic style while the background of contemporary New York City will bring the film to the current moment. Each recreated background will be drawn 3 times in order to replicate the beautifully eerie flickering shutter effect of early cinema. In all, the artist will make over 35,000 original drawings to create this feature length hand-animated film. With key organizational partners, More Art and Mastrovito will arrange hands-on workshops in which English as Seco...  \n95694  The Ixchel Song Garden, an Earthtones Project.The Ixchel Song Garden is a creative community collaboration located at the A&H's Maitland Art Center. Here, the Earthtones artists and musicians will be designing and creating a series of musical gardening tools. With these tools, we will build a terraced garden that will also be designed to produce sound through a series of percussive water drums and cymbals. This large scale earthwork, garden and full complement of tools, will serve as our instruments and our stage. And within this stage, the process of working the soil, nurturing plants and harvesting food will be our song. Over the course of a growing season, community partners will be invited to share this space by designing and building their own living sculptures. My team of lead artists and I will serve as guides and mentors. Together, we will plant a garden and make improvised music, watching as one act informs the other. The recordings we will make throughout this process will serve to create an audio soundtrack to the four month long journey through soil and seed, wind and rain, moth and honeybee. Human hands at work and at play harmonize with these ecological rhythms. This organic symphony will evolve just as the garden grows. And, as the fruits of the garden grow to harvest, we will hone and organize the music making of each community group from the improvised to the organized. The end results will be recorded CD’s of the full experience, a bounty of vegetables, ...  \n\n[5010 rows x 2 columns]"

A typical No Agenda CD is relatively easy to produce; I listen to the last few shows, clip out the segments that stand out as good introductory material, good analysis or just funny pieces and I put them together into a CD.\\nThis project will take a considerable amount of research to find all of the pertinent material. I'll be going by the calendar, of course, but I'll also be searching the show notes, Twitter and a number of other sources to make sure I'm not missing anything. This is why I'm giving myself six weeks to produce the discs. I want this to be the best product it can be.\\nThe money I'm trying to raise for this project is necessary because these discs are not being subsidized by my employer as the 'normal' No Agenda CDs are.

A couple of challenges we'll face in Edinburgh are:\\n- Selling Tickets! With over 2,000 shows a day it's pretty competitive. However we only have 65 seats to fill a night and over the years we have refined our flyering techniques! With gold lycra costumes and catchy tunes we're sure to stand out on the mile! We're also taking a flyering team,  as we know man power is important if you want to spread the word! \\n- Getting Good Reviews! We're confident our audiences will enjoy the show  but the hard part is getting those important reviewers in so they can write great stuff about the show for the world to see. However this year, with the support of Escalator East to Edinburgh, we will have a dedicated press officer to help with this. \\n- Keeping everybody happy for 25 days straight! We know what a roller coaster of ride Edinburgh can be. It's important for the whole company to feel happy, well nourished and confident. We've been to Edinburgh twice before and have experienced the highs and lows! Therefore we're confident that we know how to keep going in the face of adversity, where to get the best pick-me-up falafels and who to talk to for a bit of motherly advice.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>65803</th>\n      <td>I have many dreams and ideas writing in my Blue book and all needs to be create so...

The Evergreens has never produced a dance event like this before. In terms of staffing and support, I am teaching them along the way and they are very open to learning. But unlike working with a theater who is experienced in producing dance, The Evergreens is \"green.\" Working outside poses its own set of challenges. If it rains we have to rehearse inside. If it rains during the performances I will have to be prepared to make a call on whether or not to cancel and communicate with audience members. Audience members will be able to attend other performances if the performance they RSVP'd for is canceled.Working with young dancers outside of a school setting can be unpredictable. They are at the whim the of their parents and many forces outside of their control which may prevent them participating as fully as they would like. I am planning choreography that is flexible and modular to account for unpredictable circumstances.Having worked with all the components that exist in this project before (site-based, working outdoors, creating an evening length work, working with children, community involvement), I feel prepared to problem solve any issues that might come up along the way.

The commercial should also sound good. The amount of time it could take to complete the commercial will depend on all those issues. I also have final say on if the commercial (or banner advertising on the website) is suitable to be played on air (or placed on the website) If you are planning to purchase commercial time, I have given enough time between the end of the Kickstarter and July 1st to accomplish these tasks. If they are finished early, I will start the advertising early at no extra cost. If they happen to take a little longer to compete, I will extend the time accordingly. \\n3) Vacations, holidays, sick time and technical difficulties (including weather events that prohibit me from connecting to the internet) can interfere with the operation of the show.

Risk #1 - What if Ken Scholes cannot finish writing the story in a timely manner?  Ken is totally on board with this project and excited about writing a Poe-inspired tale.  Yes, sometimes life gets in the way and interferes with deadlines and obligations. However, I know Ken is a professional, and has met deadlines and obligations before.  Also, this a not a novel; it is an 8000 word or so short story.Risk #2 - What if there is a delay in production on my part?As stated above, there is always a risk of life getting in the way.  However, I feel confident in completing the production in the given time frame.  I am also very dedicated to making this happen to insure future productions with other pro authors.I have been involved in full-cast productions for over three and a half years now, so I know what it takes.

A typical No Agenda CD is relatively easy to produce; I listen to the last few shows, clip out the segments that stand out as good introductory material, good analysis or just funny pieces and I put them together into a CD.\\nThis project will take a considerable amount of research to find all of the pertinent material. I'll be going by the calendar, of course, but I'll also be searching the show notes, Twitter and a number of other sources to make sure I'm not missing anything. This is why I'm giving myself six weeks to produce the discs. I want this to be the best product it can be.\\nThe money I'm trying to raise for this project is necessary because these discs are not being subsidized by my employer as the 'normal' No Agenda CDs are. I'll be doing this project on my own time.To get an idea of the quality of the product, I would encourage people to visit noagendacd.com and check out some of the previous discs I have created. I have also done two clip shows for the No Agenda Show, episodes 610 and 533. My audio production value is tight and professional and I have all the high-quality equipment necessary for good voice over segments.\n67033                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Not many people are into twerking, but we are ready to change that. There is about 10 people in our group, and we are all willing to work towards changing the opinions of others. We can give a good name to twerking.\n68983                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 We have done our homework.  Pricing of all the supplies for Tile the Town and the Rewards is complete.  Many artists have already agreed to participate in the painting.  An artist on this project will seal all of the tiles.  We have a team of people to adhere the tiles to the buildings.  The reward tiles for 4 by 4 coasters will be painted by a volunteer group of artists in our public art center.  They will be mailed in padded envelopes to the donors at the various levels.  Our Arts District is in its 15th year, and we have the experience of doing public art projects and working with art classes. Should a problem arise such as some artists backing out, we have many others who will be happy to fill the void.  We have long-time experience with publicity and marketing such as press release, E-blasts, website maintenance, Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter.  We will be ready with it when we are given the green light to launch Tile the Town.  Currently we do not have another public art project.  We finished with an outdoor sculpture in October 2014 and are now looking forward to spring to get Tile the Town off and running.\n6277                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        We've been doing this for a few years and like to think that, for the most part, we're pretty okay at what we do. We've barely missed a cycle for three and a half years and we've been releasing at least one piece of content a week for about half that. We're pretty confident in saying that there's no risk of our work not turning out well.But, I'm not going to sit here and say that there aren't any risks involved with this project at all, that would just be silly. We're hoping to get at least $1000 out of this and for that to happen there's a very large chance you're hearing about us for the first time. We get it, it's a risk throwing money to some people you've never heard of and we understand if you're hesitant.For us the biggest risk is not getting funded, and that's not even a risk. If we don't get funded, so be it. We'll try again at a future date when we've made a little more progress towards being what we want to be. If we do get funded we plan on continuing to bring the same entertainment we hope we've been providing, improved in every way we possibly can.\n57680                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          One of the largest challenges we face is weather. Our students come to school four days a week and rain, cold weather, and other environmental conditions do occur. Making sure each child has the desired amount of time in the gardens is key to the success of this project. The children need as much time as they can outside understanding the stages of  growth and the positive impact that one garden can have, not only on our world and community, but most importantly, the individual.\n86743                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Some risks will be getting the city to approve of the additions we are putting on the lot.  through  extensive research and speaking to city personal I  know with backing  everything will be approved.  Another obstacle will be the weather.  Since it is a majority outdoor facility we are going to make sure there is things to do no matter the weather or circumstance. with indoor activities, heaters on the miniature golf course and a drainage system for excess water. The foundation is solid, now we just have to make the whole dream become a reality.\n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Our principle challenges are equipment failure - we have aging DJ equipment, a well-used (and well-enjoyed!) hot tub, and go through a large amount of lighting and decor each party - we need help with the capital expenditure involved, but the show will go on!\n57646                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               We might get stung! Just kidding, we don't care about silly bee stings! The main obstacle will be money, because we are broke. We both think that will be part of the charm of the film though. Here's hoping!Another obstacle will most likely be neighbors and/or our building manager.  Urban beekeeping is perfectly legal, but many people are still afraid of bees. That fear could shut us down, but we won't go down without a fight!!\n28689                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Ignite is a low-risk project. We are committed to making it happen whether or not we are able to secure funding.  If needed, we will reduce some of the more discretionary areas of the project's budget (costumes, marketing, etc.).\n1394                                                                                 Taking the show to the Edinburgh Fringe is a huge bloody deal and therefore of course has huge bloody risks! However Milk Presents are a company who take huge bloody risks and our experience has led us to believe that risks are worth taking! A couple of challenges we'll face in Edinburgh are:\\n- Selling Tickets! With over 2,000 shows a day it's pretty competitive. However we only have 65 seats to fill a night and over the years we have refined our flyering techniques! With gold lycra costumes and catchy tunes we're sure to stand out on the mile! We're also taking a flyering team,  as we know man power is important if you want to spread the word! \\n- Getting Good Reviews! We're confident our audiences will enjoy the show  but the hard part is getting those important reviewers in so they can write great stuff about the show for the world to see. However this year, with the support of Escalator East to Edinburgh, we will have a dedicated press officer to help with this. \\n- Keeping everybody happy for 25 days straight! We know what a roller coaster of ride Edinburgh can be. It's important for the whole company to feel happy, well nourished and confident. We've been to Edinburgh twice before and have experienced the highs and lows! Therefore we're confident that we know how to keep going in the face of adversity, where to get the best pick-me-up falafels and who to talk to for a bit of motherly advice.\n65803                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I have many dreams and ideas writing in my Blue book and all needs to be create so... I think the only problem maybe can be the songs and its not 100%  sometimes they let you used it, hopefully...\n93360                              This project poses a lot of new risks for me, but I feel totally equipped to face them when they come. The Evergreens has never produced a dance event like this before. In terms of staffing and support, I am teaching them along the way and they are very open to learning. But unlike working with a theater who is experienced in producing dance, The Evergreens is \"green.\" Working outside poses its own set of challenges. If it rains we have to rehearse inside. If it rains during the performances I will have to be prepared to make a call on whether or not to cancel and communicate with audience members. Audience members will be able to attend other performances if the performance they RSVP'd for is canceled.Working with young dancers outside of a school setting can be unpredictable. They are at the whim the of their parents and many forces outside of their control which may prevent them participating as fully as they would like. I am planning choreography that is flexible and modular to account for unpredictable circumstances.Having worked with all the components that exist in this project before (site-based, working outdoors, creating an evening length work, working with children, community involvement), I feel prepared to problem solve any issues that might come up along the way. I have learned over the years, there is a solution to every problem. Sometimes you have to change your perspective and as Susan Rethorst says, collaborate with circumstance.\n20359                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 My wife an I both come from agricultural upbringings, and the only stumbling block that we can see would be a bad growing season.  But for this area that risk is relatively low.  Should that happen though the garden would still be there it's yield would just be less than anticipated.\n84235                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  What are some challenges? During the first year, time will be the biggest challenge. We all have to work full time and maintain our wellness center part-time. So our time during the first year is our biggest challenge. \\nHow we hope to overcome this? We each hope to dedicate at least 2 hrs a week initially, offering group workshops and classes that will generate more more revenue per hour. We also plan to build a network of members who would contribute to our center with donations and in kind contributions.

Our combined experiences include running busy food stalls at farmers markets, technology project developments and financial small business management. Though these may appear not directly related to running an event of this nature, the key skills and confidence are what is important.Some risks can be managed through weather & events management insurance. We can also shift the event's schedule into July 2014 should delays or approvals not be ready for June 2014.\n57638                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           One of the biggest risks that our garden will face is upkeep and maintenance, especially over the summer when students are on break. We have a few teachers and staff members that live very close to the school that have already volunteered to help out as much as possible. We have assigned a garden leader who will be responsible for coordinating volunteer schedules, attracting community members to volunteer, training volunteers, and maintaining the garden over the summer and throughout the year if volunteers are unable to.Another challenge that we will face is helping students use what they learn about gardening and healthy eating in class to make their home and community a healthier place. To do this we will provide students with the knowledge and tools to create their own garden and communicate regularly with parents and guardians to encourage participation from our students' families.\n93657                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The last day of our Kickstarter campaign is one week AFTER the festival. This guarantees to our backers that the project has been successfully completed. However, there can always be unexpected obstacles or challenges that come up in the course of the project. This is live dance theater. Dancers can become sick or injured. It is also possible that we do not meet our projected box office goals. With this being said, we have a great plan in place! We are confident that we will meet the goals of our inaugural festival!\n1440                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Last year, we were just doing this for ourselves, so there were few risks. The more money we raise, however, the greater our responsibilities.  We will have to make choices about how to organize this installation/celebration, and every opportunity seized comes at the expense of other exciting opportunities. But I think that Mary and I are savvy and fun-loving enough to make choices that will lead to a very positive event.We are also mindful of not just copying or vamping other cities' Mardi Gras celebration -- something that is often done -- but of letting our own Flinty identity shine through. This will require much conversation and reflection before we commit to our decisions.Having run three successful Kickstarter campaigns, however, I think that the overall risks here are low. After all, this project is about bringing a bit of color and energy to a very gray and quiet time of year... last year our efforts were welcomed and we are confident that they will be welcomed again in 2015.\n86246                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Employees- convincing enough people this is beneficial to there future.\\nCrowds-none of this works if the crowds don't buy in to the idea\n27660                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The risk that we have at this time is being the only Burlesque and Pole Fitness Studio in Pensacola, Florida.

I'm currently looking into ordinances that may prevent me from operating in South Dakota or any other state for that matter.  The only other set back is time and money... once we get the cash, we can make the move to get the changes done.  Feel free to ask anything you may have concerns on with this project.\n6373   Risks and challenges include: \\n1) Production of bumper stickers and t-shirts will be done by a third party. The required time to make the items, have them shipped to me, and then repackaging them to be shipped back out to you all depends on their production time. Of course, I will keep everyone notified of the production schedules as applicable. \\n2) The creation of commercials requires both parties to come to an agreement on any background music (to make sure it is pod safe) and on the content (to make sure it contains suitable content for all audiences and takes the appropriate time). The commercial should also sound good. The amount of time it could take to complete the commercial will depend on all those issues. I also have final say on if the commercial (or banner advertising on the website) is suitable to be played on air (or placed on the website) If you are planning to purchase commercial time, I have given enough time between the end of the Kickstarter and July 1st to accomplish these tasks. If they are finished early, I will start the advertising early at no extra cost. If they happen to take a little longer to compete, I will extend the time accordingly. \\n3) Vacations, holidays, sick time and technical difficulties (including weather events that prohibit me from connecting to the internet) can interfere with the operation of the show. If you are buying a set number of commercials this will not affect you. But in the event that a show is missed, for any reason...\n65219                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Bridging the culture gap to be able to effectively reach and teach the girls.\n...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ...\n28811                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    As with any performance the space we use is very particular. Aerial Arts needs a tall space with the appropriate ceiling so we can rig our silks and other apparatus. Not only is our selection limited but the bigger the space, of course, the higher the price. While this was a daunting factor just a year ago, with the continued success of our studio, our rapidly growing reputation amongst the community and our consistent influx of students, we’re certain that we can meet the demands of a larger space. Just a year ago, we were renting part of a warehouse space and paying ¼ of the rent. A year later, we’ve taken over the entire warehouse and have absorbed the full cost of rent with room to spare. Now, as we all know, moving is expensive. Our new building will need to be inspected, modified to fit our unique needs, padded for safety and of course, we’ve got to move all our great stuff. That’s where you come in!Helping us with moving expenses and the cost of expansion will go a long way toward cementing Suspended Motion as a member of the San Luis Obispo County Reforming Arts community.\n20354                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The risks with this project would include lack of funding for the entire project, large scale fish deaths, diseases to both the plants and fish, inability to maintain water temperature in the winter time for tropical fish, infestation of insects, humidity issues, climate control in the winter time and not being able to sell the fish to a retailer or restaurant once they become mature.\n28495                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The main obstacle I see in the future is time, summer is here and now is the time to be on the streets or working gigs.  I want to do things the right way so I am hoping to get this Insurance project checked off the list so I can live my passion and dream. Also,  I am quite low on equipment so I want to use a percentage of the money made street performing to make my own durable sets of fire poi.  I also want to continue prototyping poi sets to eventually create some unique heavy duty fire equipment for entertainers.\n19657                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           There are not many huge risks since we're already making these Hickory Syrups, know what we need and how to do it, people want it, and stores want it on their shelves. The first kickstarter in November 2013 that started this in our kitchen taught us a lot about what it takes to fulfill rewards. All of the shipping supplies are ready ahead of time, and the ingredients and materials needed to produce the hickory syrups to fulfill rewards are available locally. The dollar amounts at each reward level were carefully figured to make sure the rewards can be fulfilled and the project needs funded. Unforeseen delays were factored into the estimated delivery, to help make sure we're able to meet it as promised before Christmas for gifts or for yourself.\n57101                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Events like ours sometimes face challenges such as we may have to change the venue  for what ever reason last minute. The good thing is NYC has so many upscale venues so finding one is not much of a challenge we've researched those that can hold live music performances so it makes the task easier should this be the case. Also performers have had to cancel last minute we always have two back up choices in case this happens. As tempting as the boat parties and garden events are to us we choose to keep out events indoors to minimize any weather issues which may arise.\n32080                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Potential issues might be not getting the volunteers to help put up the images in the Cluny main bar area. \\nWe are prepared to borrow the right tools and equipment to do this ourselves if this happens.\\nWe have been promised some local TV coverage for the first night of the exhibition.

Now, it's up to us to make this year's festival as good as it can be. Should we face some challenges along the way, we will adjust the format and potentially the scope of the festival. Instead of 9 days of programming, perhaps we will only do 6 or 7. However, we feel confident that we will be able to reach our goal and showcase 9 days of powerful content during the festival in April 2016.\n32077                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Because this project is going on with or without you fantastic Kickstarter backers making it extra awesome, I don't anticipate any risks. The artwork is all but done, and I've worked with the printer before so all rewards should be shipped out in time too. I guess the extra mannequins might not ship in time, but I would still be able to take a photo for the kickstarter. Rain might make for a less awesome photo- so we should think about that too. If this goes viral, it would be cool, but it might take me longer to mail out the rewards. which would suck.\n28715                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The instructors live in different states and will be coming together for one weekend to film the instructional DVD in Raleigh, NC.

We can do it!\n31727  You may be asking, \"Why now, in the middle of summer?\"  Putting on The Christmas House display is a family tradition that takes over 2 months of weekends to complete.  With the funding of this Kickstarter project, I am planning to add a completely new component to the project by developing choreography for at least 3 dancing light songs.  I am using some of the down-time from my teaching job to get a head start on this project during the summer months.  The ending of this project is timed to end with Christmas in July.  Rest assured, my family has been setting up and illuminating lights (with circuit breakers?!) to music for more than 15 years.  On my Google site, I have some examples of what the display has looked like with photographs taken over the years.  For this project, I will post a weekly update with any work I have done in that time, but the general timeline for work is below.Now- August 7: This year, I am putting on The Christmas House with or without dancing lights, so I have already begun developing the way I will secure light bulbs to the frame of the house.  I am also updating the outdoor electrical outlets to support the light display.August 7-September 30: Testing of all light bulb strings, ornament bulbs, and blow up ornaments. Selection of songs used for dancing light shows and beginning of light show production.October 1 - October 31: Installation of light bulbs to frame of house, bushes, and trees.  Continuation of work on dancing light programs.Novem...\n6309                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I have set the production release date from this project for May 2015.  Personally, I think it will be complete prior to that date, but since this involves asking other people for money, I extended the time frame to insure I could deliver what I promised.There are two risks that I can see for this project.  Risk #1 - What if Ken Scholes cannot finish writing the story in a timely manner?  Ken is totally on board with this project and excited about writing a Poe-inspired tale.  Yes, sometimes life gets in the way and interferes with deadlines and obligations. However, I know Ken is a professional, and has met deadlines and obligations before.  Also, this a not a novel; it is an 8000 word or so short story.Risk #2 - What if there is a delay in production on my part?As stated above, there is always a risk of life getting in the way.  However, I feel confident in completing the production in the given time frame.  I am also very dedicated to making this happen to insure future productions with other pro authors.I have been involved in full-cast productions for over three and a half years now, so I know what it takes.

I'm going to keep my operations simple, starting with 1-2 flavors, and as it unfolds then improve and develop it. It's daunting to begin a business alone, but I don't feel alone.

On top of that, the festival allows only 15 minutes for set-up before each show, in a venue with limited sound equipment.  This means we are intensely preparing ahead of time, finding work-arounds for sound, knowing we'll have to make adjustments on the fly.  Coordinating these details and managing the stress that comes with producing our show from the ground up is no easy feat.But every member of our team cares deeply about each other and the project we are building together. Even in the greatest set-backs, we find support in each other and in those who believe in us, like you.  Far beyond the show itself lies the joy of being part of such a positive community of people.  The greatest lesson we learn every day is that no matter what gets thrown our way, we can rely on each other to make this show happen.\n19607                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            My challenges will be to make enough money to by a food truck that my son can run during the summer.\\nMy risk might be I wont meet my goal of the start up money.\n69950                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Like all young businesses we face the challenge of our practice not being recognized or well received by the public.

Starting in late April/early May, we will begin creating the hundreds of glass floats needed to hide around the island. Making glass is an incredibly expensive venture and we need your help to get the ball rolling!! The funds we are seeking from this kickstarter campaign will go towards purchasing raw materials, paying for the propane and electricity that run our equipment, and other operating expenses that have to be paid to make all of this work. Without help from our kickstarter supporters, we will have to cut back on the number of floats that we would like to hide on the island next year... Less floats hidden obviously means that there will be less floats to be found!! One major change that is planned for 2015 is the hiding of smaller numbers of floats more frequently, so that the chances of finding them are spread out throughout the season. I really want YOU to find a float when YOU come to the island.. This will require more trips to the island, and more hikes around the island to hide them, but it will ensure that the odds of finding one will be better.\n84243                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Risks may include finding the small space needed at the appropriate location. We will speak to different licensed spaces in the food industry and our plan b would be to seek out a rental space with them to cater our dishes from there. \\nWe will also need to cover overhead costs once we launch our small restaurant however, with a small space, we will be selling our most popular dishes that are on demand to raise enough to cover expenses, food and raise a profit to deliver more to all.\\nWe will ensure that we keep it green, using recycling bins and maintain hygiene permits annually. We will have a day of the week that we will serve a certain dish on a special promotion and also ask clients for a testimonial on our facebook, yelp or instagram in order to leverage our client base to save on promotion fees that require using paper and instead deliver newsletters and post things on our social media websites that we will build up. it will be work but together, we can make it happen! We love international cuisine and we are happy to be a part of the food culture! Serving you warm dishes from the heart with authentic, unique recipes!\n41984                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Our biggest obstacles is of course there are millions of other podcasters out there, hopefully we are funnier and better then them. if we are funnier we are confident that our show will be the one to make it, and we are funnier, just to make that clear.\n30115                                                                                                                                                After fabricating costumes on and off my whole life, I am fully prepared to make this project. There is a lot that goes into creating a project of this size. But I've put a crack squad together and they are oh so ready for it.The biggest risk you face backing this project is not getting your rewards as early as you'd like. Many of the rewards require a lot of time from me, so please be patient while I put them together! Everything we're doing here is with lots of attention to detail, so, while I will be responsible with my time, it may take a little longer than I'd like.Other than that, there's always the crazy outside possibility my ability to perform as an artist is compromised. If that happens, rest assured my background as a designer and fabricator gives me a vast knowledge to draw upon should a problem present itself in the production of this project. We will also have a valuable secondary team of artists, designers, actors and fabricators who are on standby should a challenge present itself. No matter what we will preserve quality, integrity and overall identity of the character.Don't forget, if you choose the packages that require travel from me or you, the inherent risk is the same as there ever is with travel. But if weather or something else prohibits travel on the dates we agree to, we promise to work with you to reschedule.\n22766                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               After the project is successfully funded, we'll start to take submissions and begin with the organization of the event. Organizing an event has many obstacles but as mentioned above, we have a broad experience in creating similar events and are able to draw on a huge network of supporters and friends.\n86259                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The risk I face is getting everything updated on the cart in time for my 5/2 deadline for several markets in the area.  Many items can be ordered ahead of time, but it will be somewhat hectic in the weeks that follow to have it ready.  I will be bringing in help from family and friends to make sure it is all completed on time.\n92882                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The biggest challenge would be changing the views of the city of Detroit and getting their support. I've been turned down from a lot of venues, performing opportunities. Often times people hear \"DETROIT\" and instantly think negatively. I want to show the world that there is so much more than violence and death. I want the world to understand that ART, especially PERFORMING ARTS can make a difference in the way were viewed. I want to let the world know that you don't have to leave your home to find a garden, just sew the seeds in your own backyard.\n6291                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             I've already started recording several of these episodes and am excited to introduce you to 100 Interesting and Inspiring people.\n86706                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  My obstacles are pretty straightforward as previously mentioned; just having the money to to insure a policy with the city.\n\n[300 rows x 1 columns]"

A typical No Agenda CD is relatively easy to produce; I listen to the last few shows, clip out the segments that stand out as good introductory material, good analysis or just funny pieces and I put them together into a CD.,This project will take a considerable amount of research to find all of the pertinent material. I'll be going by the calendar, of course, but I'll also be searching the show notes, Twitter and a number of other sources to make sure I'm not missing anything. This is why I'm giving myself six weeks to produce the discs. I want this to be the best product it can be.,The money I'm trying to raise for this project is necessary because these discs are not being subsidized by my employer as the 'normal' No Agenda CDs are. I'll be doing this project on my own time.To get an idea of the quality of the product, I would encourage people to visit noagendacd.com and check out some of the previous discs I have created. I have also done two clip shows for the No Agenda Show, episodes 610 and 533. My audio production value is tight and professional and I have all the high-quality equipment necessary for good voice over segments.\n67033                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Not many people are into twerking, but we are ready to change that. There is about 10 people in our group, and we are all willing to work towards changing the opinions of others.

Pricing of all the supplies for Tile the Town and the Rewards is complete.  Many artists have already agreed to participate in the painting.  An artist on this project will seal all of the tiles.  We have a team of people to adhere the tiles to the buildings.  The reward tiles for 4 by 4 coasters will be painted by a volunteer group of artists in our public art center.  They will be mailed in padded envelopes to the donors at the various levels.  Our Arts District is in its 15th year, and we have the experience of doing public art projects and working with art classes. Should a problem arise such as some artists backing out, we have many others who will be happy to fill the void.  We have long-time experience with publicity and marketing such as press release, E-blasts, website maintenance, Facebook, Pinterest and Twitter.  We will be ready with it when we are given the green light to launch Tile the Town.  Currently we do not have another public art project.  We finished with an outdoor sculpture in October 2014 and are now looking forward to spring to get Tile the Town off and running.\n6277                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          We've been doing this for a few years and like to think that, for the most part, we're pretty okay at what we do. We've barely missed a cycle for three and a half years and we've been releasing at least one piece of content a week for about half that. We're pretty confident in saying that there's no risk of our work not turning out well.But, I'm not going to sit here and say that there aren't any risks involved with this project at all, that would just be silly. We're hoping to get at least $1000 out of this and for that to happen there's a very large chance you're hearing about us for the first time. We get it, it's a risk throwing money to some people you've never heard of and we understand if you're hesitant.For us the biggest risk is not getting funded, and that's not even a risk. If we don't get funded, so be it. We'll try again at a future date when we've made a little more progress towards being what we want to be. If we do get funded we plan on continuing to bring the same entertainment we hope we've been providing, improved in every way we possibly can.\n57680                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            One of the largest challenges we face is weather. Our students come to school four days a week and rain, cold weather, and other environmental conditions do occur. Making sure each child has the desired amount of time in the gardens is key to the success of this project. The children need as much time as they can outside understanding the stages of  growth and the positive impact that one garden can have, not only on our world and community, but most importantly, the individual.\n86743                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Some risks will be getting the city to approve of the additions we are putting on the lot.  through  extensive research and speaking to city personal I  know with backing  everything will be approved.  Another obstacle will be the weather.  Since it is a majority outdoor facility we are going to make sure there is things to do no matter the weather or circumstance. with indoor activities, heaters on the miniature golf course and a drainage system for excess water. The foundation is solid, now we just have to make the whole dream become a reality.\n5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Our principle challenges are equipment failure - we have aging DJ equipment, a well-used (and well-enjoyed!) hot tub, and go through a large amount of lighting and decor each party - we need help with the capital expenditure involved, but the show will go on!\n57646                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 We might get stung! Just kidding, we don't care about silly bee stings! The main obstacle will be money, because we are broke. We both think that will be part of the charm of the film though. Here's hoping!Another obstacle will most likely be neighbors and/or our building manager.  Urban beekeeping is perfectly legal, but many people are still afraid of bees. That fear could shut us down, but we won't go down without a fight!!\n28689                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Ignite is a low-risk project.

However Milk Presents are a company who take huge bloody risks and our experience has led us to believe that risks are worth taking! A couple of challenges we'll face in Edinburgh are:,- Selling Tickets! With over 2,000 shows a day it's pretty competitive. However we only have 65 seats to fill a night and over the years we have refined our flyering techniques! With gold lycra costumes and catchy tunes we're sure to stand out on the mile! We're also taking a flyering team,  as we know man power is important if you want to spread the word! ,- Getting Good Reviews! We're confident our audiences will enjoy the show  but the hard part is getting those important reviewers in so they can write great stuff about the show for the world to see. However this year, with the support of Escalator East to Edinburgh, we will have a dedicated press officer to help with this. ,- Keeping everybody happy for 25 days straight! We know what a roller coaster of ride Edinburgh can be. It's important for the whole company to feel happy, well nourished and confident. We've been to Edinburgh twice before and have experienced the highs and lows! Therefore we're confident that we know how to keep going in the face of adversity, where to get the best pick-me-up falafels and who to talk to for a bit of motherly advice.\n65803                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I have many dreams and ideas writing in my Blue book and all needs to be create so...

The Evergreens has never produced a dance event like this before. In terms of staffing and support, I am teaching them along the way and they are very open to learning. But unlike working with a theater who is experienced in producing dance, The Evergreens is \"green.\" Working outside poses its own set of challenges. If it rains we have to rehearse inside. If it rains during the performances I will have to be prepared to make a call on whether or not to cancel and communicate with audience members. Audience members will be able to attend other performances if the performance they RSVP'd for is canceled.Working with young dancers outside of a school setting can be unpredictable. They are at the whim the of their parents and many forces outside of their control which may prevent them participating as fully as they would like. I am planning choreography that is flexible and modular to account for unpredictable circumstances.Having worked with all the components that exist in this project before (site-based, working outdoors, creating an evening length work, working with children, community involvement), I feel prepared to problem solve any issues that might come up along the way. I have learned over the years, there is a solution to every problem. Sometimes you have to change your perspective and as Susan Rethorst says, collaborate with circumstance.\n20359                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   My wife an I both come from agricultural upbringings, and the only stumbling block that we can see would be a bad growing season.

During the first year, time will be the biggest challenge. We all have to work full time and maintain our wellness center part-time. So our time during the first year is our biggest challenge. ,How we hope to overcome this? We each hope to dedicate at least 2 hrs a week initially, offering group workshops and classes that will generate more more revenue per hour. We also plan to build a network of members who would contribute to our center with donations and in kind contributions. We have a large network of supporters to help us organize fundraising events to promote healthy eating, wellness and mindfulness. ,Based on past experience with our wellness programs, we are very optimistic that we will receive tremendous support from our network in our community.\n28651                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      We have accepted a big challenge in taking a new work to a festival overseas, and have already learned so much in rising to meet this challenge.

Our combined experiences include running busy food stalls at farmers markets, technology project developments and financial small business management.

We have a few teachers and staff members that live very close to the school that have already volunteered to help out as much as possible. We have assigned a garden leader who will be responsible for coordinating volunteer schedules, attracting community members to volunteer, training volunteers, and maintaining the garden over the summer and throughout the year if volunteers are unable to.Another challenge that we will face is helping students use what they learn about gardening and healthy eating in class to make their home and community a healthier place. To do this we will provide students with the knowledge and tools to create their own garden and communicate regularly with parents and guardians to encourage participation from our students' families.\n93657                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The last day of our Kickstarter campaign is one week AFTER the festival. This guarantees to our backers that the project has been successfully completed. However, there can always be unexpected obstacles or challenges that come up in the course of the project. This is live dance theater. Dancers can become sick or injured. It is also possible that we do not meet our projected box office goals. With this being said, we have a great plan in place! We are confident that we will meet the goals of our inaugural festival!\n1440                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Last year, we were just doing this for ourselves, so there were few risks. The more money we raise, however, the greater our responsibilities.  We will have to make choices about how to organize this installation/celebration, and every opportunity seized comes at the expense of other exciting opportunities. But I think that Mary and I are savvy and fun-loving enough to make choices that will lead to a very positive event.We are also mindful of not just copying or vamping other cities' Mardi Gras celebration -- something that is often done -- but of letting our own Flinty identity shine through. This will require much conversation and reflection before we commit to our decisions.Having run three successful Kickstarter campaigns, however, I think that the overall risks here are low. After all, this project is about bringing a bit of color and energy to a very gray and quiet time of year... last year our efforts were welcomed and we are confident that they will be welcomed again in 2015.\n86246                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Employees- convincing enough people this is beneficial to there future.,Crowds-none of this works if the crowds don't buy in to the idea\n27660                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The risk that we have at this time is being the only Burlesque and Pole Fitness Studio in Pensacola, Florida.

I'm currently looking into ordinances that may prevent me from operating in South Dakota or any other state for that matter.  The only other set back is time and money... once we get the cash, we can make the move to get the changes done.  Feel free to ask anything you may have concerns on with this project.\n6373     Risks and challenges include: ,1) Production of bumper stickers and t-shirts will be done by a third party. The required time to make the items, have them shipped to me, and then repackaging them to be shipped back out to you all depends on their production time. Of course, I will keep everyone notified of the production schedules as applicable. ,2) The creation of commercials requires both parties to come to an agreement on any background music (to make sure it is pod safe) and on the content (to make sure it contains suitable content for all audiences and takes the appropriate time). The commercial should also sound good. The amount of time it could take to complete the commercial will depend on all those issues. I also have final say on if the commercial (or banner advertising on the website) is suitable to be played on air (or placed on the website) If you are planning to purchase commercial time, I have given enough time between the end of the Kickstarter and July 1st to accomplish these tasks. If they are finished early, I will start the advertising early at no extra cost. If they happen to take a little longer to compete, I will extend the time accordingly. ,3) Vacations, holidays, sick time and technical difficulties (including weather events that prohibit me from connecting to the internet) can interfere with the operation of the show. If you are buying a set number of commercials this will not affect you. But in the event that a show is missed, for any reason, r...\n65219                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Bridging the culture gap to be able to effectively reach and teach the girls.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n28811                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      As with any performance the space we use is very particular. Aerial Arts needs a tall space with the appropriate ceiling so we can rig our silks and other apparatus. Not only is our selection limited but the bigger the space, of course, the higher the price. While this was a daunting factor just a year ago, with the continued success of our studio, our rapidly growing reputation amongst the community and our consistent influx of students, we’re certain that we can meet the demands of a larger space. Just a year ago, we were renting part of a warehouse space and paying ¼ of the rent. A year later, we’ve taken over the entire warehouse and have absorbed the full cost of rent with room to spare. Now, as we all know, moving is expensive. Our new building will need to be inspected, modified to fit our unique needs, padded for safety and of course, we’ve got to move all our great stuff. That’s where you come in!Helping us with moving expenses and the cost of expansion will go a long way toward cementing Suspended Motion as a member of the San Luis Obispo County Reforming Arts community.\n20354                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The risks with this project would include lack of funding for the entire project, large scale fish deaths, diseases to both the plants and fish, inability to maintain water temperature in the winter time for tropical fish, infestation of insects, humidity issues, climate control in the winter time and not being able to sell the fish to a retailer or restaurant once they become mature.\n28495                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The main obstacle I see in the future is time, summer is here and now is the time to be on the streets or working gigs.

Also,  I am quite low on equipment so I want to use a percentage of the money made street performing to make my own durable sets of fire poi.

The first kickstarter in November 2013 that started this in our kitchen taught us a lot about what it takes to fulfill rewards. All of the shipping supplies are ready ahead of time, and the ingredients and materials needed to produce the hickory syrups to fulfill rewards are available locally. The dollar amounts at each reward level were carefully figured to make sure the rewards can be fulfilled and the project needs funded. Unforeseen delays were factored into the estimated delivery, to help make sure we're able to meet it as promised before Christmas for gifts or for yourself.\n57101                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Events like ours sometimes face challenges such as we may have to change the venue  for what ever reason last minute. The good thing is NYC has so many upscale venues so finding one is not much of a challenge we've researched those that can hold live music performances so it makes the task easier should this be the case. Also performers have had to cancel last minute we always have two back up choices in case this happens. As tempting as the boat parties and garden events are to us we choose to keep out events indoors to minimize any weather issues which may arise.\n32080                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Potential issues might be not getting the volunteers to help put up the images in the Cluny main bar area. ,We are prepared to borrow the right tools and equipment to do this ourselves if this happens.,We have been promised some local TV coverage for the first night of the exhibition. This might fall through - if it does then we will self promote via social media and word of mouth.

Now, it's up to us to make this year's festival as good as it can be. Should we face some challenges along the way, we will adjust the format and potentially the scope of the festival. Instead of 9 days of programming, perhaps we will only do 6 or 7. However, we feel confident that we will be able to reach our goal and showcase 9 days of powerful content during the festival in April 2016.\n32077                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Because this project is going on with or without you fantastic Kickstarter backers making it extra awesome, I don't anticipate any risks. The artwork is all but done, and I've worked with the printer before so all rewards should be shipped out in time too. I guess the extra mannequins might not ship in time, but I would still be able to take a photo for the kickstarter. Rain might make for a less awesome photo- so we should think about that too. If this goes viral, it would be cool, but it might take me longer to mail out the rewards. which would suck.\n28715                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The instructors live in different states and will be coming together for one weekend to film the instructional DVD in Raleigh, NC.

They will be required to shut down traffic for a period of time, post signage...etc.Second challenge is technical - we have some technical prep so the paint will adhere to asphalt and allow the image to hang in longer than it would otherwise.\n19612                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I have to learn about bottling and nutritional values.

We can do it!\n31727    You may be asking, \"Why now, in the middle of summer?\"  Putting on The Christmas House display is a family tradition that takes over 2 months of weekends to complete.  With the funding of this Kickstarter project, I am planning to add a completely new component to the project by developing choreography for at least 3 dancing light songs.  I am using some of the down-time from my teaching job to get a head start on this project during the summer months.  The ending of this project is timed to end with Christmas in July.  Rest assured, my family has been setting up and illuminating lights (with circuit breakers?!) to music for more than 15 years.  On my Google site, I have some examples of what the display has looked like with photographs taken over the years.  For this project, I will post a weekly update with any work I have done in that time, but the general timeline for work is below.Now- August 7: This year, I am putting on The Christmas House with or without dancing lights, so I have already begun developing the way I will secure light bulbs to the frame of the house.  I am also updating the outdoor electrical outlets to support the light display.August 7-September 30: Testing of all light bulb strings, ornament bulbs, and blow up ornaments. Selection of songs used for dancing light shows and beginning of light show production.October 1 - October 31: Installation of light bulbs to frame of house, bushes, and trees.  Continuation of work on dancing light programs.Novem...\n6309                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I have set the production release date from this project for May 2015.  Personally, I think it will be complete prior to that date, but since this involves asking other people for money, I extended the time frame to insure I could deliver what I promised.There are two risks that I can see for this project.  Risk #1 - What if Ken Scholes cannot finish writing the story in a timely manner?  Ken is totally on board with this project and excited about writing a Poe-inspired tale.  Yes, sometimes life gets in the way and interferes with deadlines and obligations. However, I know Ken is a professional, and has met deadlines and obligations before.  Also, this a not a novel; it is an 8000 word or so short story.Risk #2 - What if there is a delay in production on my part?As stated above, there is always a risk of life getting in the way.  However, I feel confident in completing the production in the given time frame.  I am also very dedicated to making this happen to insure future productions with other pro authors.I have been involved in full-cast productions for over three and a half years now, so I know what it takes.

On top of that, the festival allows only 15 minutes for set-up before each show, in a venue with limited sound equipment.  This means we are intensely preparing ahead of time, finding work-arounds for sound, knowing we'll have to make adjustments on the fly.  Coordinating these details and managing the stress that comes with producing our show from the ground up is no easy feat.But every member of our team cares deeply about each other and the project we are building together. Even in the greatest set-backs, we find support in each other and in those who believe in us, like you.  Far beyond the show itself lies the joy of being part of such a positive community of people.  The greatest lesson we learn every day is that no matter what gets thrown our way, we can rely on each other to make this show happen.\n19607                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               My challenges will be to make enough money to by a food truck that my son can run during the summer.,My risk might be I wont meet my goal of the start up money.\n69950                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Like all young businesses we face the challenge of our practice not being recognized or well received by the public.

Starting in late April/early May, we will begin creating the hundreds of glass floats needed to hide around the island. Making glass is an incredibly expensive venture and we need your help to get the ball rolling!! The funds we are seeking from this kickstarter campaign will go towards purchasing raw materials, paying for the propane and electricity that run our equipment, and other operating expenses that have to be paid to make all of this work. Without help from our kickstarter supporters, we will have to cut back on the number of floats that we would like to hide on the island next year... Less floats hidden obviously means that there will be less floats to be found!! One major change that is planned for 2015 is the hiding of smaller numbers of floats more frequently, so that the chances of finding them are spread out throughout the season. I really want YOU to find a float when YOU come to the island.. This will require more trips to the island, and more hikes around the island to hide them, but it will ensure that the odds of finding one will be better.\n84243                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Risks may include finding the small space needed at the appropriate location. We will speak to different licensed spaces in the food industry and our plan b would be to seek out a rental space with them to cater our dishes from there. ,We will also need to cover overhead costs once we launch our small restaurant however, with a small space, we will be selling our most popular dishes that are on demand to raise enough to cover expenses, food and raise a profit to deliver more to all.,We will ensure that we keep it green, using recycling bins and maintain hygiene permits annually. We will have a day of the week that we will serve a certain dish on a special promotion and also ask clients for a testimonial on our facebook, yelp or instagram in order to leverage our client base to save on promotion fees that require using paper and instead deliver newsletters and post things on our social media websites that we will build up. it will be work but together, we can make it happen! We love international cuisine and we are happy to be a part of the food culture! Serving you warm dishes from the heart with authentic, unique recipes!\n41984                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Our biggest obstacles is of course there are millions of other podcasters out there, hopefully we are funnier and better then them. if we are funnier we are confident that our show will be the one to make it, and we are funnier, just to make that clear.\n30115                                                                                                                                                  After fabricating costumes on and off my whole life, I am fully prepared to make this project. There is a lot that goes into creating a project of this size. But I've put a crack squad together and they are oh so ready for it.The biggest risk you face backing this project is not getting your rewards as early as you'd like. Many of the rewards require a lot of time from me, so please be patient while I put them together! Everything we're doing here is with lots of attention to detail, so, while I will be responsible with my time, it may take a little longer than I'd like.Other than that, there's always the crazy outside possibility my ability to perform as an artist is compromised. If that happens, rest assured my background as a designer and fabricator gives me a vast knowledge to draw upon should a problem present itself in the production of this project. We will also have a valuable secondary team of artists, designers, actors and fabricators who are on standby should a challenge present itself. No matter what we will preserve quality, integrity and overall identity of the character.Don't forget, if you choose the packages that require travel from me or you, the inherent risk is the same as there ever is with travel. But if weather or something else prohibits travel on the dates we agree to, we promise to work with you to reschedule.\n22766                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 After the project is successfully funded, we'll start to take submissions and begin with the organization of the event. Organizing an event has many obstacles but as mentioned above, we have a broad experience in creating similar events and are able to draw on a huge network of supporters and friends.\n86259                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The risk I face is getting everything updated on the cart in time for my 5/2 deadline for several markets in the area.  Many items can be ordered ahead of time, but it will be somewhat hectic in the weeks that follow to have it ready.  I will be bringing in help from family and friends to make sure it is all completed on time.\n92882                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The biggest challenge would be changing the views of the city of Detroit and getting their support. I've been turned down from a lot of venues, performing opportunities. Often times people hear \"DETROIT\" and instantly think negatively. I want to show the world that there is so much more than violence and death. I want the world to understand that ART, especially PERFORMING ARTS can make a difference in the way were viewed. I want to let the world know that you don't have to leave your home to find a garden, just sew the seeds in your own backyard.\n6291                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I've already started recording several of these episodes and am excited to introduce you to 100 Interesting and Inspiring people.\n86706                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    My obstacles are pretty straightforward as previously mentioned; just having the money to to insure a policy with the city.\nLength: 300, dtype: object"
